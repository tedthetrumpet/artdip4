# 1Welcome

## 1.1Context

'A real musician's development cannot be neatly parcelled up into well-defined stages – the process is an individual one, with particular skills and musical insights achieved at different times and through different means for each person.'

Polifonia 2015:29

As this quotation from 'Perspectives on 2nd Cycle Programmes In Higher Music Education' reminds us, the division of Higher Music Education into Undergraduate, Masters and Doctorate is to a certain extent artificial. Nevertheless, there are characteristics of Masters study that are distinctive. Your previous studies and experience have given you a secure foundation in the knowledge and skills needed to pursue a career in music. As a postgraduate student, you now have the opportunity to explore and refine a distinctive artistic personality that will allow you to really make a difference in the fields in which you choose to work.

As well as continuing to develop technical and expressive mastery in your particular discipline, the Conservatoire's MMus/MA programme demands that you consolidate a well-informed critical attitude not only to your work as a musician but to the process of learning itself, and the place of your arts practice in the wider society. We capture this critical and reflective attitude in the phrase 'critical artistry' – the unending process whereby the relative values of particular artistic conceptions, insights and skills are renegotiated and repositioned in the light of new experiences and understandings.

The notion of 'critical artistry' also embodies an important epistemological point. As a performing arts institution, we take the view that knowledge is produced and consumed in-and-through performance as well in academic writing. This particular research attitude encourages you to document and reflect upon your performance practice, as a stepping stone either to the profession or to further study at doctoral level.

## 1.2Your responsibilities as a student

Given the wide range of both creative and performing disciplines addressed, we have designed a great deal of flexibility into the MMus/MA programme. Within each of the twelve strands of the programme there are a range of choices in teaching, learning and assessment that will allow you to tailor your studies to your own needs. Taken together with the inherently autonomous nature of masters study, this implies a great deal of responsibility on your part for constructing and managing your own learning.

We also expect you to contribute actively and generously to the ecology of the Conservatoire: to both support and be supported by your peers. Your responsibility radiates out from your own individual practice to your colleagues within your department, school, the institution as a whole, and the wider world. As a postgraduate student, you will be challenged to preserve and consolidate your autonomy alongside collaborative relationships with multiple networks:

- The intra-disciplinary: engagement with others working in the same discipline
- The inter-disciplinary: engagement with others working in other disciplines
- The historical: interrogation of past theories and practices which inform current work
- The transactional: engagement with a wider population which acts as spectator, learner, co-participant or constructive challenger
- The professional: engagement with professional partners and environments, including the capacity to be agents of change
- The cultural: engagement with diverse communities of practice
- The ecological: engagement with the environment, and others in it
- The digital: engagement with the technological, and virtual, environments

Further information on your responsibilities as a student may be found in the Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_, which should be read in conjunction with this Handbook.

- Nurture and develop mastery of the student's principal study, so that it is evidenced in a confident musical personality
- Promote artistic and professional confidence in the emerging artist and develop complementary skills, knowledge and understanding
- Nurture the skills and attitudes that will allow students to become independent artists, able to collaborate dynamically within a range of professional contexts
- Promote a critical and reflective approach to the student's artistic practice
- Enhance the student's ability to act autonomously in the creation of an independent project

## 3.4 Admission Criteria

### Academic Entry Requirements

Candidates for both the MMus and MA are normally expected to hold a good honours (at least 2:2) degree, or its overseas equivalent, in a subject area relevant to the demands of the programme.

### Language of Study

The language of study is English. Applicants whose first language is not English will be required to provide evidence of proficiency in English. We accept the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Level 6.0 (with a minimum score of 5.5 in each component) is required of applicants to the School of Music.

### Target Numbers

The minimum and maximum numbers for the MMus/MA programme are given below. These targets represent the total cohort in any particular year, including the one-year MA students and the two-year MMus.

| **Minimum cohort** | **Maximum cohort** |
| --- | --- |
| 16 | 174 |

The low minimum reflects the fact that the MMus/MA is not delivered in isolation, but as part of a wider offering by the School of Music as a whole.

## 3.5Programme Structure

The programme is divided into two 'stages', with Stage 1 of the MMus and the MA being identical. For all strands except Performance and Pedagogy, the structure is as follows:

The MA in Performance and Pedagogy only is available to internally progressing Conservatoire students in the following categories:

- BMus graduates who have attained the Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 1 during the course of their programme
- BEd graduates
- PGDE graduates

Under these circumstances, the structure of the programme is as follows:

### Stage 1 – MA Performance and Pedagogy (120 SCQF Credits) – Terms 1, 2 and 3

| Module | Level | Credits | Credits | Credits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Principal Study Performance and Pedagogy 1 | 11 | 60 | 60 | 60 |

| Supporting Studies 1 | 11 | 30 | 20 | 10 |
| Options | 7-11 | 0 | 10 | 20 |
|
| |
| Total | 120 | 120 | 120 |

### Stage 2 – MA Performance and Pedagogy (180 SCQF Credits) – Term 4

| Module | Level | Credits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (From Stage 1, minimum 100 credits at level 11) | 7-11 | 120 |
| Negotiated Study | 11 | 60 |
|
| |
| Total | 180 |

### Part-time Study

Stage 1 of the programme must be taken full-time.

If you are an MMus student, you may apply to complete Stage 2 on a part-time basis over the following two calendar years, allowing you to move into professional work as your studies progress. Your part-time programme will be negotiated individually, but will typically involve spreading your Principal Study tuition over two years, with B assessment/s in the first part-time year and the A assessment as the culmination of the second. Supporting Studies activities will be distributed across the two years, while any Options chosen will occupy a single part-time year.

### Transferring Between Degrees

As Stage 1 of the MMus and MA degrees is the same, it is possible to transfer between them in either direction. However, in order for us to be able to plan effectively, strict deadlines are placed on when this choice must be made. Students wishing to transfer from the two-year MMus to the one-year MA must formally notify their decision by the end of term 2; students wishing to transfer in the other direction, from the one-year MA to the two-year MMus, have until the end of term 3 to decide. Transfers in either direction are subject to the approval of the relevant Head of Department, the Head of MMus/MA, and the Director of Music.

The progression route for Tier 4 International students moving from the one-year MA to the two-year MMus programme is complicated by regulations imposed by UK Visas and Immigration. At the time of writing, it is necessary for students making this transfer to return to their home country to make a visa application. If you are an international student contemplating extending your stay, you should make contact with [international@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:international@rcs.ac.uk) at the earliest possible opportunity to get the latest guidance.

### Exit Awards

If you complete Stage 1 of the programme – through either the MMus or MA route – but decide not to complete Stage 2, then you will be eligible for the exit award of Postgraduate Diploma in Music.

If you fail to complete Stage 1 fully, but nevertheless pass both Principal Study 1 and Practice Research, then you will be eligible for the exit award of Postgraduate Certificate in Music.

## 3.8Benchmarks

The learning outcomes of your programme are aligned with a number of local, national and international standards. The _UK Quality Code for Higher Education_ (UKQCHQ, QAA 2018) lays out a series of formal 'expectations', including that 'the academic standards of courses meet the requirements of the relevant national qualifications framework'. In Scotland, these comprise the _Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework_ (SCQF 2019) and _The Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutions in Scotland_ (FQHEIS, QAA 2018).

In accordance with the SCQF/FQHEIS, both the MMus and the MA meet the requirement that a Masters degree in Scotland allocate a minimum of 180 credit points, of which at least 150 are at SCQF Level 11. The programme and module learning outcomes have been benchmarked against the _SCQF Level Descriptors_ (SCQF 2015), while the programme as a whole meets the requirements of the _UKQCHQ Descriptor for a higher education qualification at level 7 on the FHEQ and SCQF level 11 on the FQHEIS: master's degree_ (QAA 2018).

Unlike undergraduate degrees which progress through SCQF Levels 7-10 each year, postgraduate degrees sit within level 11 whatever their duration. It follows that there are no distinct 'Level Learning Outcomes' for the two years of the MMus. The programme design does however include a progression between the learning outcomes of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 modules, that are reflected in the heightened demands of the Assessment Specifications of the Principal Study 2 modules.

In addition to these fundamental standards, the programme aims and learning outcomes also take account of:

- the relevant sections of the Conservatoire's Postgraduate Academic Framework, that are themselves based upon FQHEIS
- the _Characteristics Statement: Master's Degree_ (QAA 2015)
- the Dublin for descriptors second cycle awards (EHAA 2005)
- the 'Polifonia'/Dublin Descriptors for second cycle awards in higher music education (AEC 2007)
- the AEC Learning Outcomes 2017 (AEC 2017)

The Conservatoire – then the RSAMD – became in 1993/4 the first UK institution of its kind to be granted degree-awarding powers. We take pride in the care and rigour with which we design our degrees: you can be fully confident in the academic standing of both the MMus and the MA.

## 3.9 Areas of Study

The MMus/MA is structured into twelve 'strands', each of which leads to a different named award:

- Performance
  - includes all string, woodwind and brass instruments, guitar, harp, timpani and percussion, piano solo, piano ensemble, harpsichord and voice
- Chamber Music
- Composition
- Conducting
- Historically Informed Performance Practice (MA only)
- Jazz
- Opera
- Performance and Pedagogy
- Piano for Dance
- Piano Accompaniment
- Repetiteurship
- Traditional Music

Each strand is distinguished by its own Principal Study and Supporting Studies modules: the Practice Research module is common to all strands with the exception of Opera, where it is replaced by the Role Study module.

## 3.10Learning and Teaching Methods

### Principal Study and Supporting Studies

The Principal Study and Supporting Studies modules are co-requisites. Taken together, they encompass many of the distinctive features of musical study in a Conservatoire environment at masters level. There are however distinct differences between these two core modules in both their learning and teaching methods, and in modes of assessment.

The **Principal Study** is focussed primarily on your individual development as a musician. The central plank of learning and teaching in this module is the one-to-one lesson with an expert tutor. These lessons will form part of an ongoing cycle of individual practice and reflection, and will require you to devote a substantial amount of time to independent learning. Alongside this individual activity, there will in many strands of the programme be time allocated to taught and/or supervised group activity. This includes, for example; the participation of instrumentalists in large ensemble activities; the work of singers, players, and repetiteurs in opera productions; chamber music, band, and small ensemble coaching; and ensemble podium time for conductors.

The **Supporting Studies** module comprises a wide range of individually tailored activities designed to meet the needs of each individual student. This may include: performance classes; seminars, workshops and masterclasses; attendance at concerts; rehearsals; performances, solo or group, where not assessed as part of the principal study; additional study of a related instrument or instruments; and taught classes specific to the discipline/department.

What all of these learning opportunities have in common is that they look beyond your individual development as a musician. The Supporting Studies module will ask you to work collaboratively in a widening circle of peers, potentially encompassing your colleagues within your own discipline, other musicians within the School of Music, fellow students from the Undergraduate and Research cohorts, staff and students from other Schools within the Conservatoire, and professionals from a range of disciplines both close to and far from the discipline of music.

The Principal Study and Supporting Studies modules are further differentiated by their modes of assessment. The **Principal Study** represents the primary locus of your development as a musician, and therefore offers two or three individually negotiated assessments in each year of the programme. These are not 'examinations', but will in every case represent proto-professional opportunities to demonstrate your musical skills, whether through playing, singing, conducting, composing or research; either solo or, in many cases, in a collaborative setting.

The **Supporting Studies** module is assessed on the basis of a profile of indicative grades and feedback across all of the activities undertaken. The indicative grade for a particular activity may be recorded as pass/fail, or there may be an alphanumeric grade, as appropriate: the final module grade is a pass or fail. It should be noted that, in cases where a particular activity is shared with Undergraduate students, you will still be assessed according to SCQF Level 11 (Masters) Learning Outcomes. This flexible approach to assessment allows us to reliably assess that the module outcomes have been achieved, while offering maximum flexibility in tailoring both the activities and the feedback to your individual musical goals.

### Practice Research

This module challenges you to examine critically an aspect of your arts practice by means of an individually-negotiated portfolio of research, reflection and/or documentation. Over the course of your studies, with the support of a supervisor, you will assemble a portfolio of documentation and reflective writing that interrogates a self-chosen research focus and communicates your findings. There are two negotiable deadlines for the Practice Research module, Monday 26 February 2024 and Monday 6 May 2024. The majority of students will submit for the February deadline.

(If you are a Repetiteur student you will take the Practice Research module, but in most cases base your portfolio on work alongside Opera students in the Role Study module. You can choose which part of your work on the Role Study you wish to write about in the submission – for instance, you might study a role; an opera or a series of operas (eg the three da Ponte operas); look at the continuo in Mozart recit etc; or write about some other area of interest to your discipline.)

### Role Study

This module is unique to the Opera strand, taking the place of Practice Research. It offers the opportunity to undertake artistic research into an operatic role, including the context of the opera, the libretto, and the particular character chosen. The module is taught through a blend of directed study and tutorials, supported by musical and language coaching, culminating in an informal performance of the role. The module is assessed on the basis of a 2000 word critical portfolio.

### Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy

The MMus Performance and Pedagogy strand offers the opportunity to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills related to learning, teaching and assessment in music education as an instrumental/vocal performance instructor. The programme emphasises the value of learning and teaching as a professional activity; supports the development of your identity as an instrumental/vocal performance instructor and explores teaching as a key component of their continuing growth as a performing artist.

Core to the Performance and Pedagogy strand are the two 30-credit Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy modules. Module 1 is studied in the first year – unless it has been completed as part of your BMus 4 education at the Conservatoire. The second module, Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 2, forms part of the studies in the second year of the MMus. This second module, together with Module 1, forms the core components of the professional pedagogical education required of instrumental or vocal instructors.

### Negotiated Study (or HIPP Dissertation)

The Negotiated Study module, distinctive to the MA programme, invites you to synthesise a range of skills and experiences into a largely independent and self-defined project. Learning outcomes and assessments are negotiated individually between you and your supervisor, drawing on a range of suggested projects. The potential scope of the module is broad: you might choose to undertake a performance project, initiate a creative collaboration, or research and produce a conventional dissertation. The flexibility offered allows you to demonstrate a high level of independence in pursuit of self-defined artistic and professional goals.

For students on the MA in Historically Informed Performance Practice strand, this module is replaced by the HIPP Dissertation. This module allows you to demonstrate a critical knowledge and understanding of an identified research area in the form of a 10-20,000 word written dissertation.

### Options

Options give space within the curriculum for you to engage in studies which enhance professional versatility, by pursuing areas of interest either close to or far away from your core discipline. The choice includes modules drawn from the undergraduate programmes in the School of Music as well as Interdisciplinary and Extended Practice (IXP) modules that are collaborative with the School of Drama, Dance, Production and Film.

The design of the programme puts no restrictions on the level of the options chosen. There is a significant amount of choice available in the amount of credit taken in this way: you are free to choose pathways which place greater weight on Supporting Studies.

(The Opera and Repetiteur strands include a comprehensive range of specialist activities within the Supporting Studies module that are central to the work of the Department. For this reason, participation in Options modules for students on these strands is highly exceptional, and may only take place with the prior agreement of both the Head of Opera and the Head of Programme.)

Deadlines for option modules will be notified to you by the relevant Module Coordinator, and usually also noted in your Asimut calendar.

### Additional Performance

For most strands of the programme, an extra 20 minutes a week of one-to-one tuition is available for additional study or, exceptionally, for the study of a second discipline. Under these circumstances, the total one-to-one allocation of hours may, by negotiation, be flexibly apportioned between different tutors, with at least two thirds of the tuition normally being devoted to the main discipline.

The one-to-one allocation by strand is as follows:

Historically Informed Performance Practice

- Principal Study – 60 minutes per week over 22 weeks = 22 hours
- Additional Performance – 15 minutes per week over 22 weeks = 5.5 hours
- Total – 75 minutes per week over 22 weeks = 27.5 hours

Performance and Pedagogy

- Principal Study – 60 minutes per week over 27 weeks = 27 hours
- Additional Performance – 15 minutes per week over 27 weeks = 6.75 hours
- Total – 75 minutes per week over 27 weeks = 33.75 hours

All other strands and disciplines

- Principal Study – 90 minutes per week over 27 weeks = 40.5 hours
- Additional Performance – 20 minutes per week over 27 weeks = 9 hours
- Total – 110 minutes per week over 27 weeks = 49.5 hours

The instrumental combinations that are normally allowed for additional study are noted below. Any other combination of principal study disciplines is exceptional and offered only by agreement of both the Head of Department and Head of Programme:

| **Principal instrument** | **Additional instrument** |
| --- | --- |
| Flute | Piccolo |
| Clarinet | Eb Clarinet or Bass Clarinet |
| Oboe | Cor Anglais |
| Bassoon | Contrabassoon |
| Saxophone | Clarinet or Flute |
| French Horn | Wagner Tuba |
| Trumpet | Piccolo Trumpet |
| Trombone | Alto Trombone or Bass Trumpet or Euphonium |
| Bass Trombone | Contrabass Trombone |
| Tuba | Cimbasso or Ophicleide or CC Tuba or F Tuba or BBb Tuba |
| Classical Guitar | Contemporary Guitar |
| Piano | Organ or Harpsichord |
| Violin | Viola |
| Viola | Violin |
| The following may also be available:
- Baroque and other period instruments
- Additional study in a cross-disciplinary area (classical performance, traditional music and jazz)
- An additional study area for students on the Traditional Music strand
 |

Assessment of the additional performance will normally be incorporated as part of Performance A and/or B: if this is not appropriate, it may be assessed within the Supporting Studies profile.

## 3.11Assessment

Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning, forming part of the cycle of performance, evaluation, and reflection that underpins your artistic development. It is also the mechanism which allows for a judgement as to whether you have completed the requirements of the programme, and, in the case of modules which carry a grade, to what standard. Assessment involves gathering, measuring and judging information about your progress.

Each module in the programme states learning outcomes, describing the knowledge, skills and understanding that must be demonstrated in order to pass the module. Each learning outcome is accompanied by assessment criteria, that indicate the factors which examiners will look for in order to determine whether a learning outcome has been met. The quality of the work is judged against an assessment matrix (or 'rubric'), which, in conjunction with the professional experience of the examiner, is used to determine whether the work is a pass or a fail and, in the case of assessments that carry a grade, to calibrate the level of the achievement according to the common assessment scale.

The module descriptor states the types of assessment that will be used: for most strands in the programme, a range of options are offered in the principal study assessment specifications. In cases where there is more than one graded assessment a weighting is assigned to each in order to calculate an overall module grade. All learning outcomes must be met in order to pass a module, and all summative assessments must be passed in order to pass a module.

Although the overall degree carries no classification, grades for the Principal Study module will appear on your transcript, offering evidence to other educational institutions and potential employers of the level of your achievement.

## 3.12Assessment Modes

| **Module** | **Mode of Assessment** | **Outcome** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Principal Study | Performance | Graded |
| Supporting Studies | Observation of Working Practice | Pass/Fail |
| Practice Research | Portfolio | Pass/Fail |
| Role Study | Critical Portfolio | Pass/Fail |
| Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy | Essay, Observation of Working Practice | Graded |
| Negotiated Study | Negotiated (eg Performance, Portfolio, Dissertation) | Graded |
| HIPP Dissertation | Dissertation | Graded |
| Options | Variable | Variable |

Submissions of written work through moodle are marked anonymously: however, there is nothing to prevent you from putting your name on the work should you wish.

With certain exceptions, Principal Study live in-person A assessments are externally assessed with a public audience. B assessments are usually internally assessed and non-public but may exceptionally be made public by prior agreement with the Head of Department.

Under exceptional circumstances, bespoke alternative assessments may be replace those given in the Assessment Specifications. Alternative assessments must be clearly negotiated between the Head of Department, Head of Programme and the student, and should also be approved by the Director of Music. The replacement assessment must demonstrably meet the learning outcomes of the module and be commensurate in terms of the volume and level of challenge. The requirements of the assessment should be clearly noted on the student contract, including agreement as appropriate around aspects such as the length, repertoire, scheduling, timing and/or format of the alternative submission/performance.

## 3.13Feedback on Assessment

Feedback is central to learning: its nature and purpose is related to the two main types of assessment, formative and summative:

- **Formative** assessment is concerned with your development during the course of learning: it in_forms_ you about your progress. In the MMus/MA, particular emphasis is placed on written formative assessment within the Supporting Studies module.
- **Summative** assessment usually takes place at the end of a programme of work and, in the MMus/MA, often takes the form of a performance, portfolio, or other culmination of learning. It _sums up_ your achievement, providing a clear statement of success or failure in meeting the learning outcomes of the module.

Feedback is inherent to both types of assessment. It may take many forms:

- **Verbal** , on an instantaneous basis, such as the formative feedback you receive every week in the Principal Study lesson or in a tutorial with your Head of Department.
- **Written** , as a comment on a performance, portfolio submission, or other summative outcome: you can expect detailed written feedback on all major summative assessments.
- **Mutually Constructed** , where feedback is written collaboratively by you and the tutor: this is used in many departments as an element of Supporting Studies.
- **Grades** are also a form of feedback, including the formative process grades given for Supporting Studies and the summative grades offered in the Principal Study.

For practical reasons, summative written feedback on assessments may be returned to students either through the student contract, through moodle or by email. Final ratified grades do not appear on the student contract until after the relevant exam board.

## 3.14Assessment Scale

Assessment is recorded using the Conservatoire's Common Assessment Scale. The outcome of a module may either be noted as Pass/Fail, or graded alphanumerically:

| **Common Assessment Scale** | **Descriptor** |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | Excellent |
| --- | --- |
| A2 |
| A3 |
| A4 |
| A5 |
| B1 | Very Good |
| --- | --- |
| B2 |
| B3 |
| C1 | Good |
| --- | --- |
| C2 |
| C3 |
| D1 | Satisfactory |
| --- | --- |
| D2 |
| D3 | Adequate |
| --- | --- |
| PASS |
| --- |
| FAIL |
| --- |
| E1 | Inadequate/Fail |
| --- | --- |
| E2 |
| F | Serious fail |
| --- | --- |
| NS | Non-submission/Non-appearance |
| --- | --- |

## 3.15Assessment Regulations

Please read this section in conjunction with the Conservatoire _Regulations, Codes of Procedures and General Rules._

You are required to attend all lessons, classes, rehearsals and performances as specified in this handbook or negotiated and recorded on your Student Contract. Unauthorised absence is not permitted.

Normally you may progress on the programme of study provided that:

- You have attended classes in accordance with the requirements of programme regulations and have completed all of the work of the programme of study;
- You have met the appropriate assessment requirements to the satisfaction of the appropriate Progress Committee or Board of Examiners.

To obtain a pass in a module you must normally complete all prescribed assessments to the satisfaction of the Board of Examiners. Where a module has a final assessment, you shall be permitted to take that assessment only if there is evidence that you have attended classes in accordance with the requirements of the module and have completed the work of the module.

If you disagree with the outcome of an assessment, you should in the first instance discuss this with the Head of Programme. If you are still not satisfied then you should follow the Code of Procedure for Appeals that can be found in the _Regulations, Codes of Procedures and General Rules._

### Graduation costs

There is no fee to graduate and attend the Graduation Ceremony. However, there is a fee to hire a gown which is compulsory. A fee of approximately £50 is payable to an external gown supplier and you will be advised of how to do this as part of the graduation registration process.

### Non-submission

Resits due to non-submission or non-attendance will be subject to a fee of £125 per component per resit within a module. Resits due to cheating or plagiarism shall also be subject to a fee of £125 per component per resit within a module.

### Penalties for over- and under-running recitals

In order to ensure that recital schedules run to time, and in fairness to all concerned, grading penalties are applied for recitals which over- or under-run their allotted time:

- Recitals that over-run by 10% will lose 1 increment on the Common Assessment Scale and be stopped in order to try and keep to the published schedule
- Recitals that under-run by 10-19% will lose 1 increment to a minimum of D3
- Recitals that under-run by 20% or more will fail with a grade of F.

The assessment specifications give length of the _complete recital,_ including, where appropriate, entrances and exits, spoken introductions, and resetting of the stage between pieces.

### Repetition of repertoire

Repertoire cannot normally be repeated across assessments unless there is a clear rationale negotiated and agreed with the Head of Department.

## 4.2Improving the Programme

We value your opinions, and have put in place a number of systems that allow us to both gather feedback and ensure that it is acted on appropriately.

Each year at least two student representatives are elected as members of the Postgraduate Music Programmes Committee, which is responsible for monitoring, evaluation and reviewing how the Programme is being delivered. The Committee meets three times a year, with the third meeting being an Open Forum to which all students on the programme are invited.

- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/prog-comms](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/prog-comms/)

Feedback on the programme can also be made via the online Postgraduate Music Student Suggestion Box.

Beyond the MMus/MA programme itself, all of the Departments within the School of Music have their own feedback mechanisms, and there are also Conservatoire-wide mechanisms, such as the Student Experience Forum co-chaired by the Student Union President and the Assistant Principal.

## 4.3Internationalisation

As musicians we are fortunate to inhabit a discipline that has the potential to transcend linguistic and cultural barriers while at the same time representing our various identities at the deepest level. The MMus/MA programme attracts a diverse population of international students from many different countries across the world: in a typical year, roughly one third of the total cohort may be from outside the UK. The programme also offers a range of opportunities for students to take part in international exchange programmes.

As an institution, the Conservatoire is strongly committed to maintaining an international outlook. More information can be found on the portal sites noted below, or you can contact [international@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:international@rcs.ac.uk).

- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/international-students/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/international-students/)
- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/erasmus-and-international-exchange/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/erasmus-and-international-exchange/)

## 4.4Work-based Learning

The programme has practice at its core and is delivered in a proto-professional environment. In a very real sense, therefore, all learning will be predicated upon (near) professional experience. Nevertheless, and in that context, external placements may also provide a valuable learning experience.

Placements connected with your core discipline will typically be available on a competitive basis through audition. Such placements may on occasion offer opportunities for assessment within the Principal Study: in other cases, they may sit within Supporting Studies.

The Performance and Pedagogy strand incorporates placements in an education establishment in both stages of the programme, that form an integral part of the Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy modules.

## 4.5Health and Safety, Safe Space

The policies and procedures governing the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and students are comprehensive and thorough:

- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/health-safety/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/health-safety/)

Within the School of Music we take particular care over the risks to hearing. All students are given free personal protection equipment in the form of high-quality earplugs suitable for musical use, as well as specific teaching and learning in this area as part of the programme of study.

School of Music Health, Safety and Wellbeing Action Group is convened by Alistair MacDonald, who will be happy to listen to any concerns raised by students. [A.MacDonald@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:A.MacDonald@rcs.ac.uk)

Under the Conservatoire's Dignity at Work and Study Policy, we offer the following Safe Space Statement:

'Everyone working and learning together in this room is entitled to do so in a safe space: a space free of bullying and harassment of any kind.

We will honour our differences and collaborate in the true spirit of ensemble, promoting creative challenge whilst retaining the utmost respect for each other.

We will treat one another with courtesy and respect at all times, and if we are subjected to or witness bullying or harassment we will speak out knowing that our voices will be heard and we will be taken seriously.

We will actively promote a positive, optimistic and mutually supportive approach to work and study.

Together we can create a Safe Space.

## 4.6Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

**Anti-Racism Statement**

"The [RCS Anti-Racism Action Plan](https://www.rcs.ac.uk/why-rcs/vision-and-governance/equalityanddiversity/anti-racism-action-plan-2/) (ARAP) was created in 2020 and shows key activities undertaken in our journey towards being a more equitable and just community of students and staff. RCS is in September 2023 launching a new institutional Strategic Plan taking us through to 2030. As part of this, we will be reflecting on lessons learned to date, as well as how we develop anti-racism further in a way that is embedded fully in our values and goals.

The Conservatoire has a zero-tolerance approach to racism and condemns all racist and discriminatory behaviour. We are committed to challenging and dismantling structural racism within our practices, policies, procedures, and community. In using the term 'Zero Tolerance', our meaning is that we do not tolerate acts of racism in RCS and that our response to any abuse will be timely, visible, credible, dealt with through transparent systems and in line with our policies. Students and staff, through their membership of RCS's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Forum, worked together to refine a contextualising statement about Zero Tolerance, so that it would be clearly understood across our community what is meant in using this term within an RCS context.

The Conservatoire through its policies and practice pledges to support BIPOC staff and students and those from all under-represented ethnic groups. We will take action to ensure that the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is an anti-racist environment where all staff and students can work, train, study and progress."

The School of Music Anti-Racism Action Plan is a working document developed collaboratively by students and staff in response to the wider Conservatoire Anti-Racism Action Plan. The School's plan sets out actions specific to the discipline of music across a wide range of activities, including: Outreach, Recruitment, Communications, Partnerships; Policy; Learning, Teaching, Assessment and Feedback; Programming; Staffing and Training; Student Support; Data; and Monitoring.

A distinctive feature of the MMus/MA Programme is the degree of flexibility and choice offered, for example: in the choice of Principal Study assessments; in the Independent Project and Agential Artist options within the performance strands; in the individual assessed portfolios for conductors and composers; in the MA Negotiated Project module; in the Practice Research module; and in the wide range of study paths available through the combination of Supporting Studies activities and Option modules. Rather than a fixed curriculum, the programme is designed to empower a diverse range of students to explore their own artistic personality, and through this to make a real difference in the fields in which they choose to work.

More information about the work of the School and the Conservatoire in these areas may be found on both the main RCS website and the Portal:

- [www.rcs.ac.uk/why-rcs/vision-and-governance/equalityanddiversity/](https://www.rcs.ac.uk/why-rcs/vision-and-governance/equalityanddiversity)
- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/equality-diversity/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/equality-diversity/)

## 4.7Learning Resources

The School of Music has access to a large number of purpose-built practice rooms and other rehearsal spaces that are available to students on the programme. You will have a personal quota of practice time that you can book through the Asimut timetable: larger rehearsal rooms may be booked through your Department.

There are three recording studios: studio A is staffed by a professional recording engineer, while studios B and C may be booked for student use following a short induction.

The Whitaker Library offers a comprehensive collection of material in support of the studying musician, including books, scores and audio and video recordings. The School of Music is supported by a dedicated music librarian, who will be able to assist with scores and parts for a wide range of works in the standard repertoire. A very large number of online study resources are also available through the library catalogue.

The AV store has a wide range of equipment available for students to borrow, including audio and video cameras, sound reinforcement equipment, and similar items.

Each of the instrumental Departments within the School of Music also maintains a stock of instruments of professional quality that may be borrowed and used by students.

Digital technology is not something that is bolted on to learning and teaching, but rather a part of the contemporary landscape that we all inhabit. During the first weeks of the programme you will be introduced to a number of online tools that are in daily use at the Conservatoire for communication, collaboration, and the sharing of information. These include:

- your conservatoire email
- the password self-service facility
- OneDrive for Business
- the Asimut timetabling system
- moodle
- the Student Contract
- the Portal
- eduroam wifi
- your ePortfolio
- the library catalogue

Of particular interest to music students are the state-of-the-art camera systems that have been installed in the Stevenson Hall and Ledger Recital room. These can be used by students after a short period of training that can be organised on request.

## 4.8Staff

### Heads of Department

The principal responsibility for creating an individual learning journey through the programme rests with your Head of Department. In their capacity as Module Coordinators for the Principal Study and Supporting Studies modules they will negotiate with you your one-to-one tuition, your choice of Principal Study assessments, and the range of Supporting Studies activities to be undertaken. They work together with Artistic Planning to create the wide range of performance opportunities that are central to the programme, and are responsible for allocating students to these opportunities in a fair and transparent way.

As well as taking a close interest in your musical and professional development, your Head of Department will be at hand to offer support on any difficulties that may arise during the course of the programme, either directly, by offering information and advice themselves, or by referring you on to one of the support mechanisms offered by the Conservatoire as a whole. In some large Departments there is an Associate Head and/or a Coordinator, who will also work to support you through the programme. You will also be in regular contact with your department's Programme Support Administrator who will, among other duties, manage your Asimut timetable.

### Principal Study Tutors

Your one-to-one lessons with your Principal Study Tutor are at the heart of your programme. The choice of tutor is made by negotiation with your Head of Department, who will seek to match your individual needs with the expertise of particular teachers. A student may if necessary be re-assigned to an alternative tutor: it may also be appropriate for your principal study to be shared between a number of teachers. Further information on this process may be found in Appendix 8.11 – SoM Change of Teacher Policy: Student Version.

### Head of Programme

The Head of Programme has overall responsibility for academic leadership across the MMus/MA, AdvPGDip and ArtDip programmes, as well as delivering the Practice Research module. They work in liaison with the Heads of Department to negotiate the structure and content of your programme and offer general support and advice on your progress through the degree. You are encouraged to speak to the Head of Programme at any time, particularly if there is a matter that cannot be dealt with by your Head of Department. The Heads of Department and Head of Programme report to the Director of the School of Music, who will take up any issues that cannot be resolved by the Department or the Programme.

## 4.9Copyright

The rights and obligations of students with regard to intellectual property and copyright are laid out in the Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_. Practical guidance for students may be found at [portal.rcs.ac.uk/library/copyright](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/library/copyright) and [portal.rcs.ac.uk/copyright/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/copyright/).

## 4.10Insurance

It is your responsibility to ensure that your musical instrument/s are fully insured against loss or damage whilst on the RCS premises. The Conservatoire is unable to recommend a particular insurance provider. Check first whether your instrument/s are insured through a family home contents insurance policy, and compare premiums from multiple providers before arranging a new policy.

## 4.11Student Contract

The Student Contract is part of the Student Records system that is designed to allow you to plan your personal, educational and professional development. It is a dynamic online tool to help you navigate through the programme and record the choices agreed with your Head of Department and other members of the programme team.

In specific terms the Student Contract will:

- Detail module and option choices within the programme
- Detail, where appropriate, assessment modes, placements, and work based learning
- Detail performance opportunities and other commitments that may be undertaken as part of the programme

The Student Contract will encourage you to:

- Review, plan and take responsibility for your own learning
- Articulate your personal goals and evaluate progress towards their achievement
- Articulate personal choice and context
- Gain a holistic overview of your learning and its relationship to extra-curricular pursuits and career development
- Improve study and career management skills

You can access your Student Contract through the Portal – you should familiarise yourself with this online tool at the start of your programme, and make regular reference to it throughout the period of your studies.

### Negotiation

This programme handbook, and the module descriptors which accompany it, make frequent reference to matters which are 'negotiated' or 'discussed and agreed'. For instance:

- your choice of option module is _negotiated_
- the nature and credit value of the Supporting Studies module is _negotiated_
- repertoire for certain performance assessments is to be _discussed and agreed_

In the context of the MMus/MA, these phrases have important implications. One of the underlying principles of the degree – and one of the defining characteristics of 'mastersness' – is that you should take responsibility for your own learning: the starting point for decisions around such matters as assessment pathways and options is a consideration of your individual needs as a student.

This does not mean that you have a completely free choice as to how to structure your programme: there are constraints imposed both by the practicalities of delivery and by the need to meet the learning outcomes of the programme.

In practice, the choices available to you will be made on the basis of an open and two-way discussion between you and the member of staff responsible. In all matters relating to your core discipline – in other words, the Principal Study, Supporting Studies and Negotiated Studies modules – this will be your Head of Department or, in some cases, another senior departmental member of staff delegated to the task. In other cases – for instance, the Practice Research and Option modules – the negotiation may take place with the Head of Programme or the relevant module coordinator.

If you are unhappy with the outcome of a discussion of your options with your Head of Department, a module coordinator, or other member of staff, then you should discuss the matter with the Head of Programme. If you are still not satisfied, you can approach the Director of Music. In all cases, whatever has been negotiated should be recorded on the Student Contract. It is the responsibility of the both the student and staff to make sure that this is kept up to date.

## 4.12Transitions

'Transitions' is a term used to represent three particular phases of your studies: firstly, when you move into your studies, also known as 'induction'; secondly, when, in the case of the MMus, you move from stage one to stage two; and thirdly, when you leave the programme and move into either further study or the profession.

In the induction phase you will meet your Head of Department and Head of Programme, and begin to negotiate your individual programme of study through the Student Contract.

After completing Stage 1 of the programme, you will be encouraged to review and revise your goals in preparation for Stage 2. In particular, you will use the Student Contract to select any Option modules that you wish to take in the following session: at this stage, your Head of Programme will act as your 'Transitions Tutor', guiding you through the process.

As you approach the end of the programme, you will have the opportunity to meet with your Head of Department to discuss your future plans, either for moving into the profession or further study.

## 4.13Communication

After face-to-face communication, the most widely used mode of communication is email, which is used for all official correspondence. While in other spheres you may be used to communicating via chat platforms, direct messaging, or social media, it is important that you recognise that, during your studies on the programme, all of your electronic communication with your tutors will come via your Conservatoire email address. Neither staff nor students should use their private email address for matters relating to Conservatoire business.

## 4.15Independent Learning, Autonomy and Resilience

Independent learning is at the heart of a musician's training. Whether it is the performer spending long hours in the practice room, the conductor studying and annotating scores, or the composer organising material for a new work, musicians at every level are well accustomed to taking individual responsibility for a large proportion of their musical development. Under the so-called 'apprenticeship' (or 'atelier') model, the weekly principal study lesson is the engine which drives a continuous process of independent learning undertaken by the student.

This individual focus is counterbalanced by the musician's engagement with an art form which is by its nature highly collaborative. With the possible exception of the concert pianist or solo guitarist, very few musicians build an entire career playing on their own: most are entirely dependent on collaboration with other musicians to pursue their art. At one end of the spectrum, even such a simple matter as a pianist performing with a violinist constitutes an intradisciplinary collaboration: at the other extreme, curious and creative musicians may find themselves drawn to collaborating across the full spectrum of the performing arts and beyond.

There are numerous opportunities within the programme for interdisciplinary work with other art forms. The Independent Project and Agential Artist options that sit within Principal Study 2 and the Negotiated Study module which culminates the MA programme both offer a mechanism whereby substantial credit may be gained at the heart of the programme for student-led interdisciplinary work. Furthermore, the ability to take up to twenty credits per year of learning drawn from Option modules gives you substantial scope to pursue interests far from your core discipline, building bridges to peers and professionals working in other fields.

We have purposely designed the MMus/MA framework to be highly flexible, giving you a great deal of autonomy in the design and shape of your studies. With this flexibility comes challenge: we will expect you to take a great deal of responsibility for self-organisation, for setting your own goals and finding the means to achieve them. Our hope is that as well as enabling you to work towards artistic mastery in your chosen field, that you will also develop the resilience to deal with challenges as they arise, both during the course of the programme and after you graduate.

# 5Graduate Destinations

You will graduate from the programme as a highly skilled and well-rounded musician. Whether as a performer, composer or conductor, the MMus/MA will have equipped you with the skills and abilities needed to take on and create professional work. You will have developed a critical and autonomous approach to your principal study, which will enable you to continue to develop your musicianship as your career unfolds. Statistically, the prospects are good, with the great majority of graduates from the programme progressing either to employment or further study.

### The Portfolio Career

'There is no such thing as a typical musician. The blend of roles, patterns of paid and creative work, employment status and working hours vary across musicians and across different periods in their careers. Developing a portfolio career, made up of a number of different jobs, is a necessary characteristic of many musicians' careers; this invariably involves developing non-music skills such as business, marketing, teaching and community engagement.'

_The Working Musician_ Musician's Union 2012

The quote above is one of the key findings of an extensive research project undertaken by the Musicians' Union. It accords well with the experience reported to us by our recent graduates, and is a realistic picture of the lives of many of the part-time staff who teach on the programme.

There are a number of opportunities within the programme which will help you prepare for a varied career path. The **Graduate Seminars** which form part of Supporting Studies are designed to expand your outlook beyond the principal study, with a particular emphasis on employment and entrepreneurship. These seminars will support you in areas such as tax and self-employment, understanding the funding landscape, self promotion, building a web presence, forming an ensemble, collaborating with artists from another field, preparing for auditions, and sustaining a career through safe and healthy working practices.

The **options** which form part of the programme also offer a very significant opportunity to develop complementary skills which will make you more employable. Areas which you might choose to develop include:

- **Writing and arranging music** is a useful source of income for many musicians. These skills are addressed by a number of modules in arranging, orchestrating and composing across a range of styles.
- **Community music and teaching** constitute regular and reliable employment for many contemporary musicians. Modules which you might consider include The Teaching Musician, Composing & Creative Music Making with Drake Music Scotland, Kodály Musicianship, and Introduction to Gamelan.
- Students interested in **music administration, media and marketing** should consider the Arts Leadership and Fundraising module.
- Skills in **music technology** and **sound recording** can be a valuable addition to a musician's portfolio, and are supported by a number of modules catering to students with differing existing levels of knowledge.

### Further Study

After completing our programme you may decide to proceed to further study, either here or at another institution. Some students go on to complete a second and more specialised masters degree: this is particularly the case for instrumentalists pursuing chamber music, vocalists intending to develop a career in opera, and pianists wishing to specialise in collaborative piano, whether as accompanists, operatic repetiteurs, or performing for dance. As well as a second masters degree, the Conservatoire now offers both an Advanced Postgraduate Diploma and an Artist Diploma as post-masters routes.

Many students choose to deepen and enrich their artistic practice by further study at a higher level, perhaps through the DPerf offered by the Conservatoire in association with the University of St Andrews, or through a variety of advanced diplomas offered by other institutions.

You may also be interested in pursuing research at PhD level, perhaps as a route to an academic career. A number of the Graduate Seminars will be dedicated to helping you follow this route should you so choose.

| In the second stage of the programme there is a shift in emphasis towards greater independence and self-reliance, moving towards an overarching command of accompaniment literature and the demands and expectations of the profession. In Stage 2 of the programme you may wish to pursue specialism in particular areas of accompaniment repertoire, while still being encouraged to engage with the broad spectrum of musical activity within the School of Music. Your lessons will be focussed on the specialism of piano accompaniment and will include aspects of piano technique, sound production, sight-reading and ensemble skills across a range of repertoire including instrumental sonatas, concerti, songs and accompanied pieces. Techniques for vocal coaching, transposition, and ensemble playing will also be explored.
As well as offering a heightened level of demand, the Stage 2 Assessment Specifications give you the opportunity to challenge and extend your musicality through one of two specialist options: the 'Agential Artist', in which you work with students on the MFA Classical and Contemporary Text to devise and perform new work; and the self-created 'Independent Project'. |

## Chamber Music

| **Module Title** | **Principal Study Chamber Music 1 (PSCM1)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Module Co-ordinator** | Head of Department |
| **Module Content** The role of the Principal Study lessons will be to develop a range of individual and group skills that will enable you to function effectively as a musical collaborator within the context of a chamber music ensemble. Central to your learning will be a developing ability to work with others to explore musical problems, and find aesthetically and technically satisfying solutions.
Your learning will take place through a combination of ensemble coaching and individual tuition. The proportion of these elements will be negotiated appropriately for both the individual and the group as a whole, adding up to a total equivalent to 27 x 1.5 hr lessons per group member. (For example: a string quartet might negotiate four hours of group tuition per week plus half an hour each of individual tuition for each member; a piano trio might agree three hours of coaching plus a half hour each of individual lessons, or four and a half hours of coaching and no individual lessons.)
The Assessment Specifications associated with this module outline a number of different options from which to choose, according to your department and specialism, giving you the opportunity to demonstrate the learning outcomes of the module across a range of contexts and repertoires. |

| **Module Co-ordinator** | Head of Department |
| **Module Content** This module serves to continue, extend and consolidate the work of Stage 1 of the programme, working both collaboratively and individually to achieve an advanced mastery of the chamber music form.
Your learning will take place through a combination of ensemble coaching and individual tuition. The proportion of these elements will be negotiated appropriately for both the individual and the group as a whole, adding up to a total equivalent to 27 x 1.5 hr lessons per group member. (For example: a string quartet might negotiate four hours of group tuition per week plus half an hour each of individual tuition for each member; a piano trio might agree three hours of coaching plus a half hour each of individual lessons, or four and a half hours of coaching and no individual lessons.)
As well as offering a heightened level of demand, the Stage 2 Assessment Specifications give you the opportunity to challenge and extend your musicality through one of two specialist options: the 'Agential Artist', in which you work with students on the MFA Classical and Contemporary Text to devise and perform new work; and the self-created 'Independent Project'. |

The viva voce examination takes place after the submission of the final portfolio. It is conducted by the same panel of examiners who have marked the folio itself, normally by the Head of Department, one internal examiner (not the candidate's tutor) and the Specialist External Assessor.

Work in this module is assessed by means of a submission of a portfolio of video recordings totalling 45-50 minutes, negotiated with the specialist teacher and agreed through the Student Contract. The portfolio may include work arising from participation in the Agential Artist project alongside students from the MFA Classical and Contemporary text, or an Independent Project: a practice-based project that will allow you to develop a well-defined area of specialism demonstrating the learning outcomes of the module.
The viva voce examination takes place after the submission of the final portfolio. It is conducted by the same panel of examiners who have marked the portfolio itself, normally by the Head of Department, one internal examiner (not the candidate's tutor) and the Specialist External Assessor. It allows the candidate to talk at length about their conducting work, offer a rationale for musical and technical decisions, and, through cross-examination and discussion, show a heightened understanding of the work in the context of both their individual voice and the wider cultural and musical context. |

## Historically Informed Performance Practice

| **Module Title** | **Principal Study Historically Informed Performance Practice 1 (PSHIPP1)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Module Co-ordinator** | Head of Department |
| **Module Content** This module aims to develop insight into, and practical experience of, the application of historical knowledge in the context of musical rehearsal and performance at a professional level. Working alongside professional performers, students will be introduced to sources, principles and debates surrounding the practice of historical performance. In developing professional rehearsal and performance skills, students will learn to critique and refine their own practice, and demonstrate its transformation by historical knowledge.
You will receive twenty-two one-hour lessons with an individual tutor in your instrument or voice, leading to an assessed musical performance, in collaboration with others if desired. The performance will demonstrate the application of historical knowledge and musical techniques to your overall musicianship, and provide experience in the selection, preparation and presentation of repertoire relating to the course of historical study undertaken. It aims to encourage a level of technical and stylistic acuity appropriate for professional concert situations involving musical performers of world-class standing.
The individual lessons will be supported by a series of seminars that will introduce you to the intellectual and scholarly fields in musicology that inform and support historical performance practice. These range from broad issues of culture and hermeneutics to details of source study and historical evidence for performance practice. The knowledge and understanding gained through the seminars will be demonstrated by means of a scholarly presentation and a seminar recital. |

## Performance

| **Module Title** | **Principal Study Performance 1 (PSP1)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Module Co-ordinator** | Head of Department |
| **Module Content** The Principal Study is focussed primarily on your individual development as a musician. The central plank of learning and teaching in this module is the one-to-one lesson with an expert tutor. These lessons will form part of an ongoing cycle of individual practice and reflection, and will require you to devote a substantial amount of time to independent learning. Alongside this individual activity, there will in many departments be time allocated to taught and/or supervised group activity. This includes, for example; the participation of instrumentalists in large ensemble activities; the work of singers and instrumentalists in opera productions; and chamber music and small ensemble coaching.
The Assessment Specifications associated with this module outline a number of different options from which to choose, according to your department and specialism, giving you the opportunity to demonstrate the learning outcomes of the module across a range of contexts and repertoires. |

## Performance and Pedagogy

| **Module Title** | **Principal Study Performance and Pedagogy 1 (PSPP1)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Module Co-ordinator** | Head of Department |
| **Module Content** The Principal Study is focussed primarily on your individual development as a musician and pedagogue. The central plank of learning and teaching in this module is the one-to-one lesson with an expert tutor. These lessons will form part of an ongoing cycle of individual practice and reflection, and will require you to devote a substantial amount of time to independent learning. Alongside this individual activity, there will in many departments be time allocated to taught and/or supervised group activity. This includes, for example; the participation of instrumentalists in large ensemble activities; the work of singers and instrumentalists in opera productions; and chamber music and small ensemble coaching.
The Assessment Specifications associated with this module outline a number of different options from which to choose, according to your department and specialism, giving you the opportunity to demonstrate the learning outcomes of the module across a range of contexts and repertoires. |

## Traditional Music

| **Module Title** | **Principal Study Traditional Music 1 (PSTM1)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Module Co-ordinator** | Head of Traditional Music |
| **Module Content** The Principal Study is focused primarily on your individual development as a musician. The central plank of learning and teaching in this module is the one-to-one lesson with an expert tutor. The role of the lessons will be to help and guide in developing a firm but flexible and open-minded repertoire of technical, musical and performance skills, stemming from and interpreting anew Scottish (or related) traditional music through your unique idiomatic voice. These lessons will form part of an ongoing cycle of individual practice and reflection, and will require you to devote a substantial amount of time to independent learning.
There are two principal areas within PSTM1 on which you can focus depending on your goals and discipline: solo performance or collaborative performance (group work or band), though in practice many students choose to explore a mixture of the two as this often reflects the profession. In PSTM1, you will decide in negotiation with your Principal Study tutor and the Head of Traditional Music (or Head of Piping Studies) to concentrate on one or both of these areas, with the freedom to develop your knowledge and skills through live performance, studio recorded performance and/or the composition of new traditional-idiom works. |

| **Next Steps**
 |
| **Module Title** | **Introduction to Opera Directing Intensive (IODI)** |
| **Module Co-ordinator** | Mark Hathaway |
| The module will begin with a practical investigation of the role of the opera director, which will include an analysis of the process of opera production from the moment the opera director is engaged to the final performance. Students will reflect on their own skill-base and experience to determine how completely they at this point in their learning could fulfil that role. This will in itself enable the teacher to diagnose areas of support and guidance for each learner as the module proceeds. Analysis will be introduced by group discussion, and the undertaking of tasks and further discussion in small groups, paying particular attention to political and historical context, developments in the arts as a whole, source material (eg original novel, play or myth), composition and first performance, style (eg bel canto, opera seria, opera buffa, Music Drama), plot, characters, and previous iconic productions. An Analysis Task will allow students to develop these skills independently.
A series of Practical Workshops will introduce students to rehearsal techniques and practical exercises to include movement, improvisation, the sharing of personal experience, and all aspects of workshop based learning. Rehearsal techniques to be explored include: the introductory workshop – 'getting to know you', character work and improvisation, text analysis – intention and subtext, getting started in rehearsals, advice on working with performers in a rehearsal situation, and decision making in rehearsals.
In the final assessment, the student will prepare a session designed to introduce, investigate, and rehearse a scene from the opera analysed in the Analysis Task.
Learning throughout the module is supporting by a structured reflective report that itself forms part of the assessment for the module. |

**Biv Studio Recording** – a CD studio recording of 20 minutes, arranged in collaboration with a Conservatoire studio engineer. Solo, ensemble or mixed solo and ensemble performances can be chosen for this recording. The recording may be accompanied by a written commentary (≈1000 words) on the recording process, chosen repertoire, editorial issues, performance and interpretive decisions, and a self-evaluation of the final recorded product; or, the candidate may elect to address these issues in an oral examination.

**Bv Home Studio Recording** – a recorded performance engineered and produced by the candidate. Minimum length of recorded stems is 30 minutes: the assessment to include a written commentary / oral examination. See briefing paper for further details.

## 7.2Assessment Matrix

For the postgraduate programmes in music the descriptors used in the Common Assessment Scale are supported by an Assessment Matrix (or 'rubric') that outlines what is meant at this level by 'excellent', 'very good' and so on.

|
 | Performance | Creativity | Collaboration | Research |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Excellent: A1-5 | Technically assured, highly expressive, fully focused, highly detailed, articulate, effective, imaginative, original | Boldly original, creative and intelligent work drawing on a well-founded practical and theoretical perspective | Generous, imaginative, decisive and original contribution to the ensemble, project or class; sensitive collaboration with other disciplines | A thorough command of the research area providing insights into complex issues. Original in its synthesis and an identifiable contribution to scholarship in the field |
| Very Good: B1-3 | Technically skilful, very expressive, well focused, detailed, articulate, effective and imaginative | Creative, original, and intelligent work, securely rooted in practice and theory | Active, co-operative, sustained contribution to the ensemble, project or class; openness in collaboration with other disciplines | A deep understanding of the research area with evidence of originality in a clearly focussed argument, supported by detailed reference to appropriate scholarship |
| Good: C1-3 | Technically sound, consistently expressively focused, coherent, some imagination | Imaginative work with some originality, supported by a practical and theoretical understanding | Clear contribution maintained, co-operative relationship with other disciplines | A clear understanding of the research area with evidence of independent thinking rooted in appropriate scholarship |
| Satisfactory: D1-3 | Technically sound, expressive, mainly consistent focus | Evidence of originality, drawing on practical experience and basic principles | An identifiable contribution, minimal interaction with other disciplines | An understanding of the research area, with insights mostly drawn from existing scholarship |
| Unsatisfactory, Fail: E1-2 | Technically insecure, limited expression, inconsistent focus | Limited evidence of originality and lack of insight into basic principles | Unsatisfactory interaction with little contribution | Limited insight into research area and lack of awareness of existing scholarship |
| Serious Fail: F | Technically inadequate, inexpressive, unfocussed | Unoriginal, lacking in basic understanding | No useful contribution | No understanding of research area and existing scholarship |

# 8Appendices

## 8.1Attendance, Extensions to Deadlines

### Timetabling

Your schedule of class activities is provided by the online timetabling system Asimut [rcs.asimut.net](http://rcs.asimut.net/). As well as checking your schedule, you can search for people, activities and locations, and book rehearsal or practice rooms up to 48 hours in advance.

You will receive training in Asimut during your IT induction. Complete guides to the system are available in the Asimut Student Guide and Asimut Student Booking Rules, both available via the online portal.

If you find an anomaly or clash on your timetable, you should in the first instance check with the Programme Support Administrator for your Department. If you have a more general problem with Asimut, or would like more information, then please contact [spaceplanning@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:spaceplanning@rcs.ac.uk).

### Attendance

You are expected to attend all classes and rehearsals. Poor attendance and/or poor time- keeping will have a detrimental impact on your learning and the learning of other students. It can also lead to disciplinary action in line with the Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_.

### Illness

Unforeseen absence due to illness should be logged on Asimut no later than 9:30am. You must not declare illness unless you are actually ill.

If you are involved in a large ensemble activity that day then you should:

- declare illness on Asimut _and_
- contact the Orchestral Manager, Gemma Carlin, by email (g.carlin@rcs.ac.uk) or telephone (0141 270 8240) _and_
- inform your Head of Department

If you are absent from classes due to illness for five consecutive weekdays then on your return you must submit a medical certificate to the AAS Office.

If you are absent from an assessment or unable to submit coursework on time due to illness then you should email the relevant Programme or Departmental PSA. In addition, to avoid a penalty you should submit a PMC (Personal Mitigating Circumstances) form with a medical certificate. The PMC form can be found on the landing page when you sign in to your Student Contract.

### Absence Requests

Pre-arranged absence for attending external activities, for instance a scheduled medical appointment or external concert engagement, should be requested at least seven days in advance using the absence request form on your Student Contract. You must use this system to request absence: it is not sufficient to speak informally to a member of staff about the request.

We strongly advise that you apply for authorised absence for all term-time external engagements, even if you have no Conservatoire activities listed in your Asimut timetable at the time of checking. Classes and rehearsals may change, and practical assessments may not be confirmed until three weeks before the exam. If your absence request has been approved, then we will not schedule any activities or assessments during that time.

It is your responsibility to list all affected classes, activities and assessments on the absence request form. Once the request is reviewed, your Head of Programme and Head of Department will make a decision on the outcome (approved, conditionally approved or rejected), which is then posted on your Student Contract. Not all requests will be approved, especially if assessments would be affected by the absence. For this reason, you should not make any travel plans until you have received written notification that your request has been approved.

### Unauthorised Absence

Continued unauthorised absence, including unexplained illness, will have a detrimental impact on your learning and may result in investigation and disciplinary action.

In line with the Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_, students who fail to meet attendance requirements and who fail to respond positively to written warnings on the matter may lose the right to present for examination. In this case you will not be permitted to submit work or attend the examination and the outcome will be recorded as a fail.

### Timetabling of Music Ensembles

Many of the ensemble activities within the School of Music are too complex to be captured in detail using Asimut. These are instead timetabled by the Music Ensembles Manager, including:

- Symphony Orchestra
- Chamber Orchestra
- Wind Orchestra
- Opera Orchestra
- MusicLab
- Contemporary Ensembles involved in the Plug Festival
- Jazz Orchestra
- Ballet Orchestra
- Musical Theatre Pit Orchestras and Pit Bands
- Conductors Ensemble
- Repertoire Orchestra

Asimut should only be used as a guide with regards to these rehearsals. The main point of reference is the Orchestra and Ensembles folder on One Drive. The link to this will be sent to you via email and you can save this to your favourites to reference daily. If you are involved in any activity, you should carefully take down all rehearsal and performance details in your diary. It is compulsory that you attend all rehearsals. If you do not come to a rehearsal because it isn't on Asimut, but is on One Drive, that will not be accepted as an authorised absence.

### Appendix 2 – Extensions to Deadlines

It is expected that you will manage your time to ensure that all assessment deadlines are met. Work submitted late will not be accepted, resulting in the assessment being failed due to non-submission. You will also incur the associated financial penalty of £125 per assessment.

The following are examples of circumstances which the Conservatoire would expect you to manage:

- minor illness or ailment (unless they resulted in you being unable to perform);
- personal/domestic events that could have been planned for;
- choices in personal life (eg attending weddings, holidays etc);
- transport or travel problems (unless caused by a recorded local/national crisis or a natural disaster);
- failure or theft of your computer or other equipment being used to produce the work to be assessed, including work not being backed-up;
- programme demands or misunderstanding of deadlines/dates (including failure of
- thers to submit group assignments).

However, we recognise that sometimes unexpected, serious circumstances can arise which result in a student requiring extra time. There are two routes to facilitate this:

### Extension Requests

If you know in advance that you will be unable to meet the submission deadline through good cause, you may apply for an extension to the deadline, using an Extension Request Form. Extensions should normally be requested a minimum of 48 hours in advance of the deadline. Extensions are usually only granted for 1 or 2 working days, exceptionally for a maximum of 7 calendar days.

### Personal Mitigating Circumstances

Where a significant and unexpected circumstance beyond your control has affected your studies and temporarily prevents you from undertaking an assessment or significantly impairs your performance in an assessment, you may submit a Personal Mitigating Circumstances Form. The following are examples of circumstances that would be considered as mitigating circumstances:

- serious or incapacitating injury, illness or medical condition or emergency operation.
- a significant family or personal crisis (eg bereavement or a serious illness affecting a close family member).
- unforeseen, unpreventable events (eg being a victim of a criminal act, natural disaster, including severe weather affecting travel).

The Extension Request form and Personal Mitigating Circumstances form can be found on your Student Portal landing page.

## 8.2Performance Opportunities and Commitments Policy

Productions and performances are central to your learning as a musician, and a vital part of the learning experience offered by the School of Music. This appendix is a comprehensive statement of the School's policy on the allocation of such opportunities and commitments, the principles that underpin the allocation process, the relationship between such performances and your work towards the award you are registered for, and the contribution of staff across all departments towards creating for you a balanced and individual learning journey.

It also sets out the School's expectations of you as a student and the means whereby you may appeal allocation decisions.

This policy covers a wide range of activities including, but not limited to:

- the role of singers in opera
- rchestral performances
- composing for visiting ensembles
- chamber groups
- masterclasses

### The School's expectations of you

It is a basic expectation that all students will contribute to the musical life of the School by participating in Conservatoire performances and productions. As a student you are expected, from the outset, to show comprehensive professionalism in your approach to these opportunities and commitments by being:

- present
- n time
- prepared
- focussed
- courteous of colleagues
- active and generous in collaboration

Conservatoire performances and productions represent both an opportunity for you to learn, and a commitment that comes with becoming a member of the Conservatoire's community of artists. You are therefore expected to contribute to Conservatoire performances and productions as agreed with your Head of Department.

### Principles underpinning the allocation of experiences

Two principles underpin the allocation of performance opportunities and commitments. Opportunities are allocated in such a way as:

- to enhance your own learning
- to maintain the vibrancy of the Conservatoire's musical community and therefore, by extension, enhance the learning of the community

Heads of Department, working in collaboration, will reach a decision on the allocation of roles for Conservatoire performances. Taking into account the diversity of opportunity that resides across both Schools, they will consider:

- Your individual learning journey, including assessment requirements
- Your readiness to learn from the experience
- The best role for you within an individual performance or production, given the personnel required
- The needs of other students
- The placing of the performance or production within your wider studies
- Equity of experience across departments and programmes.

The same considerations will apply for performance experiences outwith the Conservatoire, whenever Conservatoire staff are involved in the selection of student performers.

### Resolving Concerns

If you feel that a particular allocation of a performance experience is disadvantaging your learning, you should, within 48 hours of receiving the allocation, contact your Head of Department explaining why, in your view, the particular allocation is inappropriate. Similarly, if you feel that you are being disadvantaged by a lack of opportunities you should, in the first instance, raise this with your Head of Department. The Head of Department, mindful of the principles and considerations set out above, will re-evaluate the situation and, if possible, resolve your concern.

If, after discussion with the Head of Department, you do not feel that your concern has been satisfactorily resolved, you may appeal the allocation by writing to the Head of Programme (Undergraduate or Postgraduate), who will liaise with the Head of Department and the appropriate Programme Board to seek a resolution. The result of this discussion, and a rationale for the resulting decision, will be given to you in writing. If, at this stage, you feel that this decision does not provide a satisfactory resolution, you may appeal in writing directly to the Director of Music according to the process set out in Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_.

### Performance Ethics

The Performance Opportunities and Commitments Policy operates in tandem with the Conservatoire's Performance Ethics Policy that can be found on the Ethics moodle page [https://inspire.rcs.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=5009](https://inspire.rcs.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=5009).

If you have a concern about the ethics of a performance in which you are involved, please speak in the first instance to your Head of Department or Head of Programme.

## 8.3Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct includes cheating, collusion, and plagiarism. Essentially, all work submitted for assessment should be yours except in cases where group work is a specific requirement of an assignment.

Plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct are serious disciplinary matters that will incur a £125 financial penalty. Further strictures may include:

- having to resit an assessment
- having to resit the module
- having to retake a year of study
- having to leave the Conservatoire

Further information, including the mechanism for appeal, may be found in the Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_.

## 8.4Briefing on the Performance and Pedagogy strand

The MMus Performance and Pedagogy strand offers the opportunity to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills related to learning, teaching and assessment in music education as an instrumental/vocal performance instructor. The programme emphasises the value of learning and teaching as a professional activity; supports the development of your identity as an instrumental/vocal performance instructor; and explores teaching as a key component of your continuing growth as a performing artist.

Core to the Performance and Pedagogy strand are the two 30-credit Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy modules. Module 1 is studied in the first year – unless it has been completed as part of your BMus 4 education at the Conservatoire. The second module, Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 2, forms part of the studies in the second year of the MMus. Taken together these modules form the core components of the professional pedagogical education required of instrumental or vocal instructors.

Various terms have been utilised to describe the professional practice of instrumental and vocal pedagogues. For the purposes of clarity in the Scottish context, the term 'instructor' has been applied to describe all instrumental and vocal tuition which occurs in 1:1 and small group settings in schools and other educational establishments.

This strand is designed to support you in developing the skills and attributes required to become reflective, enquiring music instructors. It provides a rationale for the value of learning and teaching as a professional activity integral to music and musicianship. It provides practical advice and support to enhance the confidence and development of instructors alongside evidence-based, theoretical approaches to learning, teaching and assessment.

The strand aims to:

- provide you with opportunities to develop a critically reflective and evidence-based approach to learning, teaching and assessment;
- provide an enabling, engaging and interactive environment for you to develop as an effective and confident music instructor;
- provide opportunities for you to engage with the _Standards for Registration for Instrumental Music Instructors_ and other professional codes of conduct to explore the knowledge, activities and values expected of instrumental and vocal instructors;
- encourage you to develop inclusive learning and teaching approaches that recognize, value and respect diverse learners;
- assist you to take a scholarly, enquiry-informed approach to your learning, teaching and assessment practices.

Overall the strand models and explicitly encourages consistent links between:

- theories of learning and teaching;
- instrumental and/or vocal tuition specific challenges and opportunities;
- the need for developing an inclusive and appropriately challenging curriculum in line with national and institutional strategies;
- national learning and teaching policies and strategies and the relationship to teaching and assessment practices.

### Structure and Design

The Performance and Pedagogy strand has a smaller volume of credit in the Principal Study module, achieved by limiting the one-to-one lesson time to one hour per week and slightly modifying the assessment demands. The Practice Research module is replaced by the Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 1 and 2 modules. The usual structure of the strand is therefore:

| Stage 1 |
- Principal Study Performance and Pedagogy 1 (60 credits)
- Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 1 (30 credits)
- Supporting Studies/Options (30 credits)
 |
| --- | --- |
| Stage 2 |
- Principal Study Performance and Pedagogy 2 (60 credits)
- Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 2 (30 credits)
- Supporting Studies/Options (30 credits)
 |

The design of the strand also recognises that some students may be graduates of the RCS BMus programme and may already have completed Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 1. In such a case, these students would be expected to continue on the strand with Instrumental and Vocal 2. Internally progressing students therefore have three alternative routes to complete the Performance Pedagogy strand:

| Stage 1 |
- Principal Study Performance and Pedagogy 1 (60 credits)
- Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 2 (30 credits)
- Supporting Studies/Options (30 credits)
 |
| --- | --- |
| Stage 2 |
- MMus Performance Stage 2
 |

Or

| Stage 1 |
- MMus Performance 1
 |
| --- | --- |
| Stage 2 |
- MMus Performance and Pedagogy Stage 2
 |

Or as a 1-year MA route:

| Stage 1 |
- Principal Study Performance and Pedagogy 1 (60 credits)
- Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 2 (30 credits)
- Supporting Studies/Options (30 credits)
 |
| --- | --- |
| Stage 2 |
- MA Negotiated Study (60 credits)
 |

Given the requirement of placements in each of the Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy modules, APL will not be applicable to this strand.

### The Performance and Pedagogy Pathway and the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS)

At RCS we are committed to providing high quality professional learning for _all_ teachers and instructors – regardless of affiliation/registration with professional bodies. The Performance and Pedagogy strand has been designed from this commitment to professional learning for music instructors but also in acknowledgement of developments in the wider educational community in Scotland. The General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS), after consultation with professional music education partners, including RCS, has developed in collaboration with practitioners and sector representatives the _Standards for Registration for Instrumental Music Instructors: mandatory requirements for Registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland_ (2015). While these Standards are, at present, non-mandatory (in that a separate category for the registration of instrumental/vocal teachers has not yet been created), they do provide a series of professional benchmarks which can facilitate the planning of professional learning and development and as such the vision and values of this strand derive from this set of professional standards.

The _Standards for Registration for Instrumental Music Instructors_ describes three areas which detail the key requirements of any teacher or instructor, detailing the values that someone performing these activities should embrace and exemplify (Professional Values and Personal Commitment), what they should know in order to carry out those activities appropriately (Professional Knowledge and Understanding) and what an effective teacher should be able to do in terms of teaching or supporting learning (Professional Skills and Abilities).

### Recognition of professional learning and affiliation with General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS)

Completion of the MMus Performance and Pedagogy strand will allow graduates _to reach the standard required to pursue affiliation_ as an instrumental/vocal instructor with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS). At the time of writing automatic affiliation, or indeed registration, is not possible for instrumental music instructors, however, the learning gained from completion of the MMus can be utilised to evidence professional learning and can be used for the purposes of an application made directly to the GTCS by the student after graduation.

### Placements

In each of the Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 1 and 2 modules you will engage in 20 days of compulsory placement in an educational context, approximately one day per week over 20 weeks.

For IVP1, this placement will be in a school. In IVP2, students have the opportunity to 'specialise' and may wish to pursue a placement, again arranged by RCS, in an early years establishment, school (Primary/Secondary) or in a specialised learning context (eg Junior Conservatoire). Each placement will be for one day per week for a 20 week period.

The strand enjoys a close working relationship with colleagues in Glasgow City Council and North Lanarkshire Council and your placements will take place in one of the two local authorities.

At the start of the MMus programme you will be asked to provide accurate details regarding your term-time residence to help aid the allocation of placement.

### Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 1 (30 credits, SCQF Level 10)

The aim of this module is to support students in exploring and establishing the foundational values, ideas and professional dispositions expected of an instrumental and vocal instructor in Scotland and beyond. This module is significant in terms of helping you to reflect seriously on teaching and instruction as a choice of vocational career.

**Whole group class themes**

The following content provides insight into the content covered in this module. While the order of the sessions may change across the academic year, the content will remain intact and will encourage you to reflect on your growing identity as an instrumental instructor.

**Session 1: Learning and Teaching in School:** this session will provide an overview of Module 1 aims, intended learning outcomes, content and assessments. The session will introduce you to the _Standards for Registration for Instrumental Music Instructors_ in addition to other policies and documentation related to teacher and instructor professionalism. The session will also involve critical discussion of the concept of pupil-centred learning.

**Session 2: Enhancing Teaching Using Learner Feedback:** this session provides an introduction to the importance of evaluation within schools. It will cover a range of possible methods that you can use to evaluate their pupils' learning and their own teaching and assessment practices.

**Session 3: Enhancing Pupil Learning** : this session will provide an introduction to some of the key research about children and young people's learning and contextualises this within the discipline of Music performance.

**Session 4: Curriculum Design:** this session will outline a range of different approaches to curriculum design, and deepening understanding devising a programme of study for learners to promote their musical growth.

**Session 5: Assessment and Feedback:** this session will provide an opportunity to explore the role of assessment within education. We will examine the role of assessment in different contexts and the differences between assessment _of_ learning and assessment _for_ learning. A range of different methods of assessment will be discussed as well as many challenging and relevant elements of designing good assessment and providing constructive feedback to learners.

**Session 6: Working with ensembles:** this session will explore how to work with ensembles of learners effectively. A range of different approaches will be explored including practical techniques for making large group work engaging and effective for all.

**Session 7: Small Group Teaching:** this session will introduce students to a range of different approaches to teaching in small group settings. It will provide evidence of effective approaches as well as useful suggestions for enhancing learner engagement.

**Session 8: Supporting Learning with Technology:** The session will introduce you to some of the key technologies which are used within the school to support learning and teaching.

**Session 9: Using Evidence to Enhance Practice:** This final session will explore your professional growth and the next steps in your own learning.

**Assessment**

For IVP1 there are two summative assessments: a written assignment of a 3000-word reflective analysis, and one teaching observation and reflection.

**Assessment 1: 3000-word reflective analysis**

For this assessment, you are required to present a clear teaching philosophy statement which explores your beliefs of teachers and teaching prior to (and after) placement. It also requires the identification of two critical incidents/significant moments from teaching practice in the music classroom, with a clear explanation of each incident/moment showing understanding and insight via critique of the incident in light of wider reading.

**Assessment 2: Teaching observation plus reflection**

For this assessment, you are required to undertake one formally observed lesson which will be a joint observation by an experienced instrumental/vocal tutor from the Conservatoire alongside your school-based mentor.

After the observed lesson you are required to provide documentary evidence of your teaching observation in the form of (a) observation report (a joint report between the school and the RCS tutor) and (b) your reflection on the feedback provided (including next steps for your own practice). Your reflection will be approximately 1000 words and it is expected that it acts as a response to the feedback received from your (formally) observed lesson.

While on placement you should maintain a record of work (i.e., lesson plans) which detail your planning with learners and next steps for your own practice. This should be created on OneDrive and shared with your school mentor and RCS tutors in the first week of placement.

### Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy 2 (30 credits, SCQF Level 11)

This module is the second key component of the Performance and Pedagogy strand. The main focus of this module is on specialist instrumental and vocal pedagogy. You will be allocated a placement in an educational establishment – an early years establishment, school, specialist school/context. Private lessons out with the programme of study are not appropriate for this module.

You will experience small group and whole group class teaching. All classes aim to be of practical use to you as well as being informed by the relevant literature about specific instrumental and vocal pedagogy and support them towards the assessments.

**Small group classes**

Small group teaching will be based on instrumental/vocal pedagogy with a specialist instrumental/vocal tutor from the Conservatoire who will work with you to develop your understanding of specific, specialised pedagogy pertinent to their instrumental/vocal family.

**Whole group classes**

Whole class teaching will be utilised for supporting you to develop their enquiry skills in order to help them meet the requirements for Summative Assessment 1.

The following content provides insight into the content covered in this module. While the order of the sessions may change across the academic year, the content will remain intact and will encourage you to reflect on your growing identity as an instrumental instructor.

**Session 1 Enquiry as a means of professional learning:** this session will introduce you to the concept of professional enquiry and the value this process has for the purposes of teaching and learning.

**Session 2 Designing an enquiry:** this session will support you in identifying an area of their teaching practice that they would like to explore in greater depth and demonstrate the approach to designing an enquiry of your own choice.

**Session 3 Searching for literature:** this session will be hosted in conjunction with colleagues in the library and will provide you will the opportunity to develop their search and analysis skills for the purposes of locating educational research literature.

**Session 4 Ethics and enquiry:** this session will introduce you to the importance of educational ethics when engaging with the process of enquiry for the purposes of learning and teaching.

**Session 5 teaching-based data collection:** this session will explore the data that teachers can use within your enquiries; it will introduce the concept of lesson-based evidence (i.e., evidence that is generated through learning and teaching and which teachers use on a day-to-day basis to inform their teaching practice) and other approaches to data collection which are found within educational research.

**Assessment**

For IVP2 there are two summative assessments: a written assignment of a 3000-word enquiry and, two teaching observations and reflections.

**Assessment 1: 3000 word enquiry**

This assignment requires you to identify an aspect of their teaching practice that they would like to explore through a small enquiry into their teaching practice. You will provide a rationale as to why the area has been selected for exploration and why it is important for learners. You will also be expected to demonstrate awareness of the ethics of educational research and link their findings to existing research literature.

**Assessment 2: Teaching observation plus reflections**

As in IVP1, you are required to undertake one formally observed lesson. This will be a joint observation by an experienced instrumental/vocal instructor from the Conservatoire alongside their school-based mentor.

After the observed lesson you are expected to provide documentary evidence of your teaching observation in the form of (a) observation report and (b) your reflection on the feedback provided. Your reflection will be of approximately 1000 words and it is expected that it should respond to the feedback received from the observed lesson.

While on placement you should maintain a record of work (i.e., lesson plans) which detail your planning with learners and next steps for your own practice. This should be created on OneDrive and shared with your school mentor and RCS tutors in the first week of placement.

### Wider educational experiences: Professional Learning Week

Students on the MMus Performance and Pedagogy strand will be required to engage with the wider Initial Teacher Education (ITE) Professional Learning Week, a week of educational and professional activities for education students at the Conservatoire. This is a week for opportunities for networking and learning from specialist guests from a variety of relevant educational contexts in Scotland, including Education Scotland, GTCS and school partners.

### Professional learning opportunities post-MMus Performance and Pedagogy

Beyond the MMus, successful completion of the Performance and Pedagogy strand can provide you with an entry-point to further opportunities for continuing professional development around learning and teaching or indeed to further and refine your development as a musician.

Opportunities for further study include Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) (Music) for those who wish to pursue classroom Music teaching. Please note, however, that if you wish to pursue further study as a classroom teacher of Music, there are specific, mandatory entry requirements expected for applicants stipulated through the GTCS Entry Memorandum (2019). Further details can be found here: [https://www.rcs.ac.uk/postgraduate/professional-graduate-diploma-in-education-music/](https://www.rcs.ac.uk/postgraduate/professional-graduate-diploma-in-education-music/)

## 8.5Briefing on the Studio Recording assessment

### What is the Studio Recording assessment?

The Principal Study studio recording assessment enables you to be assessed on the basis of a studio recording – that is, a recording that takes full creative advantage of the tools of the modern studio. This means that your studio recording should be carefully crafted to reflect, in Glenn Gould's phrase, your 'best thoughts' on the music.

### Assignment

The precise assignment depends on your award and department. In each case, the length and musical requirements are slightly different, but the common elements are:

- Submission of the studio recording
- _Either_ an oral examination exploring the creative process in the studio _or_ a written commentary

The details for each award and department are given in the Assessment Specifications for the relevant Principal Study module. You should check carefully that you have noted the correct length of recording that must be submitted, and any other requirements that may be particular to your instrument, voice, or discipline.

### What are the examiners looking for?

Examiners are looking for a fine studio performance, which will be assessed on the basis of the submitted recording according to our standard criteria for performance (which are given in the Principal Study module descriptors in the Programme Handbook) and, in addition, a creative use and understanding of the studio medium, which will be assessed in the oral examination or written commentary.

In the oral examination or written commentary (whichever you choose), you are expected to demonstrate:

- Your ownership and engagement in all aspects of process, whether you produced your own recording, or worked with a producer
- Your part in shaping the recorded sound quality (eg present, distant, dry, reverberant, etc) and spatialisation
- Your role in the selection of edit points, and a rationale for these edit points
- Your understanding of context for your recording, with reference to other recordings

Consideration of these criteria will form the basis of the oral examination or commentary. A single holistic grade is awarded for the performance and the oral examination or commentary.

### Process

- Students who elect the studio recording assessment will have the opportunity to request a discussion with the recording studio engineer to discuss programme choices and approaches to the process.
- According to need, a trial recording session may be arranged. This will allow you to begin being comfortable being recorded and hearing your recorded sound.
- You will make your final recording with the recording studio engineer. Following your session you will be receive the audio files from the session via OneDrive.
- Listen to the recordings and provide a marked up score with a reasonable amount of editing, clearly identifying where edits should be made. You should also provide a set of notes describing the edits and their purpose whether this is musical, technical or otherwise. The recording studio staff will then make a first edit for you to check and, where appropriate, make a second edit or remix of the tracks. You will not be expected to attend the editing session. A [PDF](http://portal.rcs.ac.uk/mmus-ma/wp-content/uploads/sites/3012/2022/08/How-to-mark-up-a-score-for-editing.pdf) is available with more information about editing.
- Following the completion of the recording, the finished tracks must be submitted for marking, accompanied by a clear track listing.

### Recording elsewhere

Your recording does not have to be recorded in the studios of the Conservatoire. However, if you choose to record elsewhere you are of course responsible for the entire process. If you would like to record at the Conservatoire using your own producer, you should discuss this in advance with the recording studio engineer.

We **strongly advise** that you should **not** attempt to do the recording or editing yourself, whether using a home studio or a studio to which you may have access. This is a Principal Study assessment, where we are chiefly interested in your ability to use the studio medium to realise a musical performance. You are **not** being assessed on your ability to use studio hardware and software yourself: the intention is that you learn how to work with a professional who is qualified in this area, **not** that you attempt to become a recording engineer yourself.

### Strategies for the Studio Recording Option

You will need to keep detailed notes on the process of making the recording, including the discussions you have with the recording studio staff or other producer. You should make sure that you are ready to demonstrate all of the assessment requirements given above by detailed reference to specific examples – this could include an annotated score with edit points marked, a log of 'takes', notes on practice recordings and even photographs of the recording setup and venue.

### Audio or Video?

A number of the departments allow the submission of video recording. If you choose to go down this route, you should be aware of certain limitations. You will not easily be able to use different takes to assemble a performance: each movement will need to be played entire. Furthermore, a video made in a recording studio may be compromised by the layout and lighting of a room not designed for that purpose. If you choose to go down this path, you should be prepared to discuss this decision in your commentary or oral examination.

### Studio Time

Classical students: ten to fifteen minute submissions are allowed ninety minutes of studio time, fifteen to twenty minute submissions are allowed two hours of studio time, thirty minute submissions are allowed three hours. These can be split into two sessions if required. This does not include time spent editing.

Folk and Jazz students: six hours are allowed for a thirty minute submission (multitrack and set up time). This does not include mixing time.

### Submission

Finished submissions should be made online, accompanied by a track listing and, if chosen, your written commentary. The process is:

- Download the files from OneDrive.
- Listen to the recordings to make sure that you are happy with the final edits.
- Make sure you are submitting the finished tracks, not the rough takes! You may wish to rename the files to make this clear.
- Write up a track listing to make it clear to the examiner what they are supposed to be listening to, and in what order. For instance:
  - Track 1 – Mozart Horn Concerto No 4 in Eb Mvt 1
  - Track 2 – Mozart Horn Concerto No 4 in Eb Mvt 2
  - etc
- Upload both the finished tracks and the track listing document to the appropriate submission dropbox on moodle

If you are submitting a written commentary instead of the oral examination, then this must be submitted alongside the recordings as well.

### Deadline

There are two possible deadlines for the studio recording assessment:

- Deadline 1 – **Friday 08 March 2024**
- Deadline 2 – **Friday 17 May 2024**

Which of these deadlines you are working to must be **negotiated** with your Head of Department and/or the Head of MMus Programme and recorded on your learning contract. Once a deadline is agreed, it may not be changed unless there are mitigating circumstances.

It is important that you plan ahead, and book your studio sessions well ahead of time. You must also allow for a two-week window between submitting your edits and receiving the final recordings. For this reason, studio time at the RCS will not normally be available after Friday 3 May 2024 **.**

If you choose to produce a written commentary, it must be submitted at the same time as the recording. The oral examinations, where agreed, will normally be held between a week and a fortnight after the submission of the recording.

### Recording Studios at the RCS

There are three recording studios on the Renfrew Street Campus.

**Studio A** is the largest and best equipped studio in the RCS. It is staffed by a professional and experienced recording engineer, and is best suited for music recording. There is a large 70 square meter live room, with a separate drum booth and a full size Steinway.

There are also four 4K cameras and video lights.

As well as providing the best possible recordings, Studio A aims to give students the experience of working in a professional studio. Students are therefore encouraged to be as well prepared and rehearsed as possible, to be punctual, to inform the engineer of any changes to their session, and to have a responsible attitude towards cancellations.

Peak studio times are March to end of June.

- Bookings should be made via email to [b.whitney@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:b.whitney@rcs.ac.uk)
- Bookings will be accepted on a first come first served basis.
- Studios are free of charge for students. (Staff and outside bookings are charged at £70 per hour + VAT. Outside bookings will only be considered at non-peak times.)
- Where recordings are being made for your own purposes rather than for assessment, you will need written authorisation from your Head of Department or Head of Programme.
- If a student brings a group or ensemble into the studio, the majority of musicians must be RCS students: a string quartet must have three students in it, a jazz sextet must have four students etc. (Exceptions to this rule may be made, but will require written authorisation from the Head of Department or Head of Programme)
- Accompanist piano students cannot bring in non-student soloists to record.
- Video recording and editing is available, either single camera or multi-camera, please advise beforehand if multicamera is wanted.
- The recording facilities can only be used by engineers approved by the studio manager. A staff member must be present at all times if the live area being used for a rehearsal.

**Studios B & C** are more basic studios that can be booked and run by students after they have completed a short introductory course. They both have Pro Tools DAW and a small selection of microphones. They are also used for teaching and drama classes. Studio B is room 369 and Studio C is 261, to book contact Client Services.

**Venues:** all student concerts in the Stevenson Hall, AGOS and the Ledger Room are recorded and available to students on request. Recordings can be made in the Stevenson Hall, AGOS and the Ledger Room on the overhead microphones at any time, provided enough notice is given to program the recorder. Competitions cannot be recorded unless permissions have been given by the Director of Music. Public exams can be recorded on request, no other exams can be recorded.

## 8.6Briefing on the New Work assessment

### What is the New Work assessment?

Working with a composer to create a new work for the first time takes a special array of skills, and can be an exciting and fulfilling process. The New Work assessment enables you to be assessed on your performance of a new work, composed in the course of the academic session, and the collaborative process that supported it.

### Assignment

The precise assignment depends on your award and department. In each case, the length and musical requirements are slightly different, but the common elements are:

- A live performance or studio recording
- _Either_ an oral examination exploring the creative process in the studio _or_ a written commentary

The details for each award and department are given Assessment Specifications for the relevant Principal Study module. No length of work is stipulated in the assessment requirements, reflecting the fact that the length in minutes of a new work does not necessarily reflect the challenge it presents. Therefore, in agreeing the arrangements for this assessment with your Head of Department, the 'challenge' presented by the new work needs to relate to the weighting assigned to it within the module (25% or 50%).

Please note that it is not permissible to perform a _pre-existing_ contemporary work in this assessment, nor can there be any overlap of repertoire with another Principal Study assessment. It is also not acceptable for the new work assessment to write your _own_ work, although this might form the basis of an independent project.

### What are the examiners looking for?

Examiners are looking for a fine performance of a new work, assessed according to the standard criteria for performance given in the Principal Study module and evidence of collaboration with the composer, which will be assessed in an oral examination.

In the oral examination, you are expected to demonstrate:

- The nature, extent and effectiveness of your creative collaboration with the composer
- Your role in shaping the work at different levels
- Your understanding of the context for the new work, with reference to other works featuring your instrument

Consideration of these criteria will form the basis of the oral examination or commentary. A single holistic grade is awarded for the performance (or recording) and the oral examination or commentary.

### Process

- Students who elect the new work assessment will have the opportunity to meet with a selection of the composers currently studying at the Conservatoire and members of the Composition Department.
- Once you have found a composer to work with, you should arrange to meet and confirm the arrangements for the project with your Head of Department and/or the Head of MMus programme. The name of your collaborators and the details of the proposed work should be recorded on your student contract.

### Strategies for the New Work assessment

During the course of the project, you are advised to keep in touch with your Head of Department and/or the Head of MMus programme. In particular, it is important to let us know if the timelines are slipping, or the collaboration is not proving successful. If this happens, it may be possible to change to another performance assessment: such changes require a minimum of six weeks notice.

You will need to keep detailed notes on the process of working with the composer. You should make sure that you are ready to demonstrate all of the assessment requirements given above by detailed reference to specific examples – this could include sequence of annotated draft scores or excerpts from scores, notes on modifications and creative experiments, notes on practice sessions and audio or video recordings of rehearsals.

### Deadline

If you choose to be assessed in live performance, you will need to agree the timing of your assessment with your Head of Department in your student contract. If you choose to be assessed through a studio recording, the deadline for submission of the recording is negotiated in the student contract, usually no later than **Friday 17 May 2024**.

Oral examinations will normally be held between a week and a fortnight after the performance or recording submission.

## 8.7Briefing on the Independent Project assessment

### What is the Independent Project assessment?

The independent project is an opportunity for you to create your own unique assessment mode for the Principal Study module. This assessment is in general only available to Stage 2 students, and is compulsory for Stage 2 of the Traditional Music programme. For students on other performance programmes, it is a chance to pursue a strong and original idea for a performance-based project that does not fit easily into one of the pre-defined performance assessments.

### Assignment

The independent project assessment is available to all of the departments within MMus Performance, as well as Conducting and Jazz. In all of these cases, it may be taken as a 50% A assessment (externally assessed) and/or a 25% B assessment (internally assessed). Within MMus Performance it is possible to combine these into a single project with a weighting of 75%. As noted above, it is mandatory as an A assessment for Traditional Music, with a weighting of 70%.

Although the assessment details will vary from project to project, there must be a _performance_ outcome of some sort: this might be live, recorded, or some combination of the two. In many cases an _oral examination_ will form part of the assessment process, and it may also be appropriate to produce a _reflective account_ of the project, possibly accompanied by _documentation_.

As every project will be different, there is no stipulation as to the length or nature of the performance outcome. In agreeing the arrangements for this assessment with your Head of Department, the 'challenge' presented by the project needs to relate to the weighting assigned to it within the module (25%, 50%, 70% or 75%).

### What are the examiners looking for?

Whatever the nature of the project, examiners are looking for a fine performance, assessed according to the standard criteria for performance given in the Principal Study module descriptors. Examiners will also look for the synthesis of different kinds of knowledge, which may be assessed by, for instance, an oral examination, a reflective account, or documentation.

Whatever modes of assessment are agreed, a single holistic grade will be awarded for the project as a whole.

### Strategies for the Independent Project assessment

During the course of the project, you are advised to keep in touch with your Head of Department and/or the Head of MMus programme. In particular, it is important to let us know if any factors emerge outwith your control which are likely to affect the completion of the project. If this happens, some renegotiation of your assessments may be possible: such changes require a minimum of six weeks notice.

You should keep detailed notes on the progress of the project, for example: a record of meetings and rehearsals, annotated scores, audio and video of work in progress, photographs and scans, and notes on recording sessions. These materials might be brought to an oral examination, or submitted as part of a portfolio of evidence.

### Deadline

If you choose to be assessed in live performance, you will need to agree the timing of your assessment with your Head of Department in your student contract. If you choose to be assessed in whole or part through a portfolio of evidence (for example, recordings, reflection, documentation), the deadline for submission of the portfolio is negotiated in the student contract, usually no later than **Friday 17 May 2024**.

Where there is an oral examination, this will normally be held between a week and a fortnight after the performance or recording submission.

## 8.8Briefing on the Agential Artist assessment

### What is the Agential Artist assessment?

The Agential Artist assessment gives you the opportunity to work on a three-month collaborative project with students on the MFA Classical and Contemporary Text, leading to a public performance of new work at an external venue in January.

### What do I have to do?

Students on the MFA Classical and Contemporary text undertake to lead and manage a 60 credit module called 'The Agential Artist'. The module descriptor states:

'This module expects the student to take substantial ownership of their learning. Students will develop, rehearse and perform one-hour original projects inspired by classical and/or contemporary text. These performances might represent expansion and further development of projects undertaken in the On the Verge festival or entirely new projects. Performances will occur at an off-site venue.

As a music student, you will work closely as part of a creative team drawn from the MFA programme. Your commitment would be:

### Term 1 Week 1 – Encounter

From Tuesday to Friday of week 1 you will spend four full days with the MFA students and mentoring team at Wallace Studios. This time will be used to explore initial ideas, uncover ways of working, and establish the teams and projects that will go forward to develop and develop new works.

### Term 1 – Twilight Sessions

The cohort of MFA and MMus students taking part in the project will meet with the mentors one evening a week to monitor progress, discuss ideas, and share work in progress. (tbc, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday 1800-2100)

### Term 2 Weeks 1-3 – Rehearsal and Performance

The productions will go into full-time rehearsal in January, initially at Wallace Studios and/or Renfrew Street, moving into the external venue in weeks two and three for final rehearsal and performance. During this period you will be expected to have no other commitments, whether externally or within the School of Music.

### How will I be assessed?

It is important to realise that, although you will be working together as a team, the Agential Artist project has a different status within the MMus programme to that of the MFA programme. The assessment is therefore not identical. As an MMus student, the project forms part of Principal Study 2 and is in most cases internally assessed as a 50% B column option according the learning outcomes and assessment criteria of that module. For MMus composers, work arising from the project will be incorporated as part of the Portfolio submission.

To take full advantage of the collaborative nature of the project, the final performances will be viewed by an assessment team that includes experts from both the School of Music and the School of Drama, Dance, Production and Film. You will thus have the chance to receive feedback on your work from multiple perspectives, although your final grade will be given by the assessors from the School of Music.

### How will I be supported?

You will have an individual mentor from the School of Music, who will also form part of the mentoring team alongside staff from the MFA programme. You may also wish to discuss with your Head of Department whether a proportion of your Principal Study lesson time might be spent with a tutor or tutors who have particular expertise in the musical challenges of the particular project under development.

### Budget

The Conservatoire will cover the hire cost of the external venue and a professional producer.

In addition, each individual MFA/MMus student will be allocated a £500 budget towards the project. These individual budgets may be aggregated, so that, for instance, a team of four people working together would have a total budget of £2000. The team are entirely responsible for how this money is spent: examples might include set, props, costumes, technical support, equipment hire, additional rehearsal time, or anything else that is needed to support the work being developed.

For MMus students, the funds to cover the individual project will be drawn from the departmental budgets for additional study: this means that the additional 20 minutes a week (9 hours total) that may be negotiated for the study of related (or, exceptionally, unrelated) study will not be available to students undertaking this assessment option.

## 8.9Briefing on the Home Studio Recording assessment (Wind and Brass)

This assessment option invites you to create a recorded performance that is a work in its own right, rather than a substitute for a live performance. Unlike the Studio Recording option, the intention is that you will engineer and produce the work yourself.

### What do I have to do?

You must submit an audio work that showcases your playing on your principal study instrument. In many cases this will be a multi-track recording where you play all of the parts in a piece.

### Can I play more than one instrument?

The central aim is to showcase your playing on your main instrument or related instrument/s – for instance, three flutes; or flute, piccolo and alto flute.

If you are confident that you can play a second instrument to a high standard, then that is fine, but be careful of lowering the quality of the overall recording: Masters-level trumpet playing accompanied by grade 6 trombone may not sound that good!

### Can I collaborate with other performers or do I have to play everything myself?

Collaboration with other players is fine, but remember the main aim of the performance is to show off your own playing.

### Do I have to arrange the piece myself?

You can do, but it is also fine to use an existing arrangement.

### How does the length requirement work?

The minimum length requirement relates to the total amount of playing in each of the individual 'stems' you play. For instance, a three-minute recording where you play all nine parts of a piece yourself equates to 27 minutes. The length calculations do not include any parts played by you on an unrelated instrument, nor do they include any parts played by anyone else.

### What recording equipment and software should I use?

This is entirely up to you: this option puts the responsibility for the engineering and production of the work entirely in your hands. You should not attempt this option unless you are confident that you have access to appropriate audio recording equipment, and access to and experience of suitable editing software. That said, there are staff members in the School of Music who have expertise in these areas who may be able to help: please feel free to ask for advice.

### Can I record video?

Multi-screen video is certainly possible, but there will be additional practical challenges in creating and editing both high quality audio _and_ video. You should only attempt this if you are very certain that you have suitable equipment and access to and experience of both audio _and_ video editing software.

### How will I be assessed?

The Learning Outcomes are the same as for any other Principal Study assessment: examiners will be looking for you to demonstrate technical and expressive mastery; a mature musical personality; and knowledge, understanding and critical thinking expressed through the process of making music.

As well as the recording, you have the choice either of submitting either a short contextualising written statement (~1000 words) or undertaking an oral examination. In both cases, the examiners will be seeking to understand your approach. Why did you choose to record this repertoire in this way? How did you go about it? What musical and technical obstacles did you hit, and how did you get around them? What would you do differently next time?

### Where can I get help?

You should seek musical advice from your Head of Department and Principal Study tutor.

There are many projects of this type online that you may wish to look at for inspiration: there are also many online tutorials. Be critical: are there flaws in intonation, timing problems, or inexpert playing? Does the technical advice appear accurate and up-to-date?

We expect you to engineer and produce the work yourself, so we cannot teach you how to use the recording equipment or software. However, there are staff members within the School of Music who have expertise in these areas who may be able to help: please feel free to ask for advice.

### Deadline

There are two possible deadlines:

- Deadline 1 – **Friday 08 March 2024**
- Deadline 2 – **Friday 17 May 2024**

Which of these deadlines you are working to must be **negotiated** with your Head of Department and/or the Head of MMus Programme and recorded on your learning contract. Once a deadline is agreed, it may not be changed unless there are mitigating circumstances.

If you choose to produce a written commentary, it must be submitted at the same time as the recording. The oral examinations, where agreed, will normally be held between a week and a fortnight after the submission of the recording.

## 8.10Briefing on the Home Studio Recording assessment (Trad Music)

This assessment option invites you to create a recorded performance that is a work in its own right, rather than a substitute for a live performance. If chosen, in MA (Traditional Music) or MMus (Traditional Music) 1, this component comprises 50% of your Principal Study grade. If chosen in MMus (Traditional Music) 2, this component comprises 30%.

Unlike the standard Studio Recording option, the intention is that you will engineer and produce the work yourself.

### What do I have to do?

You must submit an audio work that showcases your playing on your principal study instrument. In many cases this will be a multi-track recording of several sets or songs. The repertoire must **not** overlap with your Performance A programme.

### Can I play more than one instrument?

The central aim is to showcase your playing on your main instrument or related instrument/s – for instance, Highland bagpipe, border pipes and low D whistle. Singers could include both Scots and Gaelic repertoire, though you should seek the advice of department staff if unsure of your standard in one Principal Study song tradition or the other.

If you are confident that you can play a second instrument to a high standard, then that is fine, but be careful of lowering the quality of the overall recording: Masters-level fiddle playing, over which you lay a track of quite basic guitar accompaniment may not meet the appropriate standards of sound and arrangement quality.

### Can I collaborate with other performers or do I have to play everything myself?

Collaboration with other players is fine and indeed encouraged. You may wish to be accompanied by others, or your own Principal Study may be fundamentally involved in accompaniment such as bodhran, guitar or pipe band snare drum. Remember however that the main aim of the performance is to show off your own playing, so you must be clearly audible throughout the recordings, and the accompaniment must be of an appropriately high standard.

### Do I have to arrange the piece myself?

You can do, but it is also fine to use an existing arrangement or to work with peers. The recording component assesses performance skills as opposed to arrangement skills, but the arrangement should be of a high enough standard to facilitate Masters-level performance.

### How does the length requirement work?

The minimum length requirement relates to the total amount of playing in each of the individual parts you play, if more than one. For instance, a ten-minute recording involving three instruments consistently through the recording, and you play all three instruments yourself, would equate to 30 minutes. The length calculations do not include any parts or instruments played by anyone else.

### What recording equipment and software should I use?

This is entirely up to you: this option puts the responsibility for the engineering and production of the work entirely in your hands. You should not attempt this option unless you are confident that you have access to appropriate audio recording equipment, and access to and experience of suitable editing software. That said, there are staff members in the School of Music who have expertise in these areas who may be able to help: please feel free to ask for advice.

What musical and technical obstacles did you hit, and how did you get around them? What would you do differently next time?

### Where can I get help?

You should seek musical advice from your Head of Department and Principal Study tutor.

There are many projects of this type online that you may wish to look at for inspiration: there are also many online tutorials. Be critical: are there flaws in intonation, timing problems, or inexpert playing? Does the technical advice appear accurate and up-to-date?

We expect you to engineer and produce the work yourself, so we cannot teach you how to use the recording equipment or software. However, there are staff members within the School of Music who have expertise in these areas who may be able to help: please feel free to ask for advice.

## 8.11SoM Change of Teacher Policy: Student Version

This policy is about situations where you would like to change your 1:1 teacher. This is a short, student-facing version of the [full policy](http://portal.rcs.ac.uk/mmus-ma/wp-content/uploads/sites/3012/2022/08/2022-03-17-Change-of-Teacher-Policy.pdf).

### Background

When you begin studies in the School of Music, you are allocated to a 1:1 Principal Study teacher by your Head of Department (HoD). We do our best to accommodate requests to study with a particular teacher, where we have advance notice, but we can't promise to fulfil all requests.

You have the option to share your annual allocation of 1:1 lesson time between different teachers – this can be beneficial where you are studying complementary or highly specialised techniques or genres, for example. Sharing of lesson time has to be done with the agreement of your Head of Department.

### Our Policy

It is School of Music policy to support requests to change teacher, or to share lesson time between different teachers, so long as your HoD believes that to be in your best interests.

### What should I do if I'd like to discuss my progress?

You should speak to your 1:1 teacher in the first instance. If you don't feel able to discuss concerns about your progress directly with your teacher, then speak to your HoD. Concerns about progress do not always result in changing teacher. It's good practice to discuss your progress with your HoD at least once a year, usually after the end-of-year assessments: your HoD may use this meeting to ask you to confirm that you're happy to continue with your current teacher.

### I just want an occasional lesson from a different teacher

If you would like the occasional lesson with a different teacher, simply discuss this with your HoD.

### But what if I want to change my 1:1 teacher or to share lesson time with another teacher?

The process that follows is for situations where you would like to change teacher, or to share lesson time with another teacher on an ongoing basis.

Here's what to do if you'd like to change teacher or share lesson time on permanent basis:

1. Talk to your Head of Department

- explain why you'd like to change teacher
- talk about your progress to date and your ambitions
- your HoD will also take account of your stage in your studies, your length of time with your current teacher and the availability of other teachers
- your HoD may decide that a change of teacher is not in your best interests at this time. In this case, you should meet with your HoD again after, say, another 4 weeks to review the situation.
- if you are unhappy with this outcome, you can appeal the decision to the Director of Music.

2. You (or your HoD) meet with your current teacher

- if your HoD thinks that changing teacher is in your best interests, they will encourage you to discuss the request directly with your current teacher
- if you feel unable to discuss your request directly with your teacher, tell your HoD and they will discuss the request with your teacher instead. They will explain fully to your teacher the reasons for your request
- your HoD will offer you support through this process, and give you a timeline for changing teacher

3. Approaching new teachers

- you must not approach a possible new teacher or have a consultation lesson with a new teacher until your HoD gives you permission. This is because it is courtesy for your current teacher to be aware that you are seeking to change teacher.
- when you approach a possible new teacher, the teacher will check with the HoD that you have permission

4. Conclusion of process

- nce a new teacher has agreed to take you, the change needs to be confirmed by your HoD
- the change may be temporary or permanent
- the timing of the change should be made clear by your HoD. Normally, the change will coincide with a natural break in studies (e.g. beginning of a new academic year or a new term)
- it may not always be appropriate for lessons with your current teacher to stop immediately ‒ your HoD may judge that it is best for you to continue with your current teacher for a few more lessons.

### What happens after I change teacher?

We will do our best to avoid situations where you might be examined by a former teacher. Teachers are expected to maintain professional objectivity at all times in relation to former students, and to make this clear by their actions, words and conduct.

### What if my teacher suggests that I move to a different teacher?

This doesn't happen very often; if it does, your teacher or your HoD will explain the rationale.

### Where can I go for support?

If you need support through this process, please contact:

- your Head of Department
- your Head of Programme
- the Students Union [susupport@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:susupport@rcs.ac.uk)
- the Deputy Registrar [m.green@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:m.green@rcs.ac.uk)
- RCS Counsellors [https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/counselling/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/counselling/)

### Notes

- References to 'Principal Study' also include 'Additional Performance Study' and 'Second Study' etc.
- If your 1:1 teacher is your HoD, and you don't feel able to discuss the request directly with them, you should contact the Associate HoD, or Head of Programme, or the Director of Music.
- The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland subscribes to the '[Principles of Best Practice in Conservatoire Teaching](https://conservatoiresuk.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CUK-best-practice-FINAL-.pdf)', which has been adopted by Conservatoires UK. The Conservatoire's [Dignity at Work and Study Statement](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/hr/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2021/01/Dignity-at-Work-and-Study-Statement-and-Guidance.pdf) is also relevant in the context of this Policy.
