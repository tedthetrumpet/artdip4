# Learning Environment


## Student Support

The main hub of student support is the Academic Administration and Support (AAS) team, managed by the Academic Registrar. The Registrar also administers the Appeals and Complaints procedures and can be contacted for advice in either of these areas. If you have a complaint about the service or information provided by the Royal Conservatoire you should consult the Complaints Handling Procedure, which is included in the Royal Conservatoire's Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules.

## Improving the Programme

We value your opinions, and have put in place a number of systems that allow us to both gather feedback and ensure that it is acted on appropriately.

Each year at least two student representatives are elected as members of the Postgraduate Music Programmes Committee, which is responsible for monitoring, evaluation and reviewing how the Programme is being delivered. The Committee meets three times a year, with the third meeting being an Open Forum to which all students on the programme are invited.

- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/prog-comms](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/prog-comms/)

Feedback on the programme can be made via the online Postgraduate Music Student Suggestion Box.

Beyond the programme itself, all of the Departments within the School of Music have their own feedback mechanisms, and there are also Conservatoire-wide mechanisms, such as the Student Experience Forum co-chaired by the Student Union President and the Assistant Principal.

## Internationalisation

As musicians we are fortunate to inhabit a discipline that has the potential to transcend linguistic and cultural barriers while at the same time representing our various identities at the deepest level. The postgraduate programmes in the School of Music attract a diverse population of international students from many different countries across the world: in a typical year, roughly one third of the total cohort may be from outside the UK. The programme also offers a range of opportunities for students to take part in international exchange programmes.

As an institution, the Conservatoire is strongly committed to maintaining an international outlook. More information can be found on the portal sites noted below, or you can contact [international@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:international@rcs.ac.uk).

- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/international-students/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/international-students/)
- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/erasmus-and-international-exchange/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/erasmus-and-international-exchange/)

## Work-based Learning

The programme has practice at its core and is delivered in a proto-professional environment. In a very real sense, therefore, all learning will be predicated upon (near) professional experience. Nevertheless, and in that context, external placements may also provide a valuable learning experience.

Placements connected with your core discipline will typically be available on a competitive basis through audition. Such placements may on occasion offer opportunities for assessment.

## Health and Safety, Safe Space

The policies and procedures governing the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and students are comprehensive and thorough:

- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/health-safety/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/health-safety/)

Within the School of Music we take particular care over the risks to hearing. All students are given free personal protection equipment in the form of high-quality earplugs suitable for musical use, as well as specific teaching and learning in this area as part of the programme of study.

School of Music Health, Safety and Wellbeing Action Group is convened by Alistair MacDonald, who will be happy to listen to any concerns raised by students. [A.MacDonald@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:A.MacDonald@rcs.ac.uk)

Under the Conservatoire's Dignity at Work and Study Policy, we offer the following Safe Space Statement:

'Everyone working and learning together in this room is entitled to do so in a safe space: a space free of bullying and harassment of any kind.

We will honour our differences and collaborate in the true spirit of ensemble, promoting creative challenge whilst retaining the utmost respect for each other.

We will treat one another with courtesy and respect at all times, and if we are subjected to or witness bullying or harassment we will speak out knowing that our voices will be heard and we will be taken seriously.

We will actively promote a positive, optimistic and mutually supportive approach to work and study.

Together we can create a Safe Space.

## Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

**Anti-Racism Statement**

"The [RCS Anti-Racism Action Plan](https://www.rcs.ac.uk/why-rcs/vision-and-governance/equalityanddiversity/anti-racism-action-plan-2/) (ARAP) was created in 2020 and shows key activities undertaken in our journey towards being a more equitable and just community of students and staff. RCS is in September 2023 launching a new institutional Strategic Plan taking us through to 2030. As part of this, we will be reflecting on lessons learned to date, as well as how we develop anti-racism further in a way that is embedded fully in our values and goals.

The Conservatoire has a zero-tolerance approach to racism and condemns all racist and discriminatory behaviour. We are committed to challenging and dismantling structural racism within our practices, policies, procedures, and community. In using the term 'Zero Tolerance', our meaning is that we do not tolerate acts of racism in RCS and that our response to any abuse will be timely, visible, credible, dealt with through transparent systems and in line with our policies. Students and staff, through their membership of RCS's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Forum, worked together to refine a contextualising statement about Zero Tolerance, so that it would be clearly understood across our community what is meant in using this term within an RCS context.

The Conservatoire through its policies and practice pledges to support BIPOC staff and students and those from all under-represented ethnic groups. We will take action to ensure that the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is an anti-racist environment where all staff and students can work, train, study and progress."

The School of Music Anti-Racism Action Plan is a working document developed collaboratively by students and staff in response to the wider Conservatoire Anti-Racism Action Plan. The School's plan sets out actions specific to the discipline of music across a wide range of activities, including: Outreach, Recruitment, Communications, Partnerships; Policy; Learning, Teaching, Assessment and Feedback; Programming; Staffing and Training; Student Support; Data; and Monitoring.

More information about the work of the School and the Conservatoire in these areas may be found on both the main RCS website and the Portal:

- [www.rcs.ac.uk/why-rcs/vision-and-governance/equalityanddiversity/](https://www.rcs.ac.uk/why-rcs/vision-and-governance/equalityanddiversity)
- [portal.rcs.ac.uk/equality-diversity/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/equality-diversity/)

## Learning Resources

The School of Music has access to a large number of purpose-built practice rooms and other rehearsal spaces that are available to students on the programme. You will have a personal quota of practice time that you can book through the Asimut timetable: larger rehearsal rooms may be booked through your Department.

There are three recording studios: studio A is staffed by a professional recording engineer, while studios B and C may be booked for student use following a short induction.

The Whitaker Library offers a comprehensive collection of material in support of the studying musician, including books, scores and audio and video recordings. The School of Music is supported by a dedicated music librarian, who will be able to assist with scores and parts for a wide range of works in the standard repertoire. A very large number of online study resources are also available through the library catalogue.

The AV store has a wide range of equipment available for students to borrow, including audio and video cameras, sound reinforcement equipment, and similar items.

Each of the instrumental Departments within the School of Music also maintains a stock of instruments of professional quality that may be borrowed and used by students.

Digital technology is not something that is bolted on to learning and teaching, but rather a part of the contemporary landscape that we all inhabit. During the first weeks of the programme you will be introduced to a number of online tools that are in daily use at the Conservatoire for communication, collaboration, and the sharing of information. These include:

- your conservatoire email
- the password self-service facility
- OneDrive for Business
- the Asimut timetabling system
- moodle
- the Student Contract
- the Portal
- eduroam wifi
- your ePortfolio
- the library catalogue

Of particular interest to music students are the state-of-the-art camera systems that have been installed in the Stevenson Hall and Ledger Recital room. These can be used by students after a short period of training that can be organised on request.

The Conservatoire is also piloting the use low-latency (LoLa) audiovisual streaming in instrumental music teaching: more information on this technology is available from PhD student Ben Redman [B.Redman@rcs.ac.uk](mailto:B.Redman@rcs.ac.uk).

## Staff

### Heads of Department

The principal responsibility for creating an individual learning journey through the programme rests with you the student, working closely with your Head of Department. They will negotiate with you your one-to-one tuition, your choice of assessments, and the range of activities to be undertaken.

As well as taking a close interest in your musical and professional development, your Head of Department will be at hand to offer support on any difficulties that may arise during the course of the programme, either directly, by offering information and advice themselves, or by referring you on to one of the support mechanisms offered by the Conservatoire as a whole. In some large Departments there is an Associate Head and/or a Coordinator, who will also work to support you through the programme. You will also be in regular contact with your department's Programme Support Administrator who will, among other duties, manage your Asimut timetable.

### Principal Study Tutors

Your one-to-one lessons with your Principal Project Tutor are of course at the heart of your programme. Your Head of Department will discuss and agree with you the best person for you to study with: in some cases, this may involve dividing your time between a number of tutors.

### Head of Programme

The Head of Programme has overall responsibility for academic leadership across the MMus/MA, AdvPGDip and ArtDip programmes. They work in liaison with the Heads of Department to negotiate the structure and content of your programme and offer general support and advice on your progress through the programme. You are encouraged to speak to the Head of Programme at any time, particularly if there is a matter that cannot be dealt with by your Head of Department. The Heads of Department and Head of Programme report to the Director of the School of Music, who will take up any issues that cannot be resolved by the Department or the Programme.

## Copyright

The rights and obligations of students with regard to intellectual property and copyright are laid out in the Conservatoire's _Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules_. Practical guidance for students may be found at [portal.rcs.ac.uk/library/copyright](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/library/copyright) and [portal.rcs.ac.uk/copyright/](https://portal.rcs.ac.uk/copyright/).

## Insurance

It is your responsibility to ensure that your musical instrument/s are fully insured against loss or damage whilst on the RCS premises. The Conservatoire is unable to recommend a particular insurance provider. Check first whether your instrument/s are insured through a family home contents insurance policy, and compare premiums from multiple providers before arranging a new policy.

## Student Contract

The Student Contract is a mechanism that allows you to plan your personal, educational and professional development. It is a dynamic online tool to help you navigate through the programme and record the choices agreed with your Head of Department and other members of the programme team.

In specific terms the Student Contract will:

- Detail module and option choices within the programme
- Detail, where appropriate, assessment modes, placements, and work based learning
- Detail performance opportunities and other commitments that may be undertaken as part of the programme

The Student Contract will encourage you to:

- Review, plan and take responsibility for your own learning
- Articulate your personal goals and evaluate progress towards their achievement
- Articulate personal choice and context
- Gain an holistic overview of your learning and its relationship to extra-curricular pursuits and career development
- Improve study and career management skills

You can access your Student Contract through the Portal – you should familiarise yourself with this online tool at the start of your programme, and make regular reference to it throughout the period of your studies.

### Negotiation

This programme handbook and module descriptors make reference to matters which are 'negotiated' or 'discussed and agreed'. In the context of this programme, these phrases have important implications. One of the underlying principles of the programme – and one of the defining characteristics of 'mastersness' – is that you should take responsibility for your own learning: the starting point for decisions around such matters as assessment pathways and options is a consideration of your individual needs as a student.

This does not mean, of course, that you have a completely free choice as to how to structure your programme. Both students and teachers are constrained on the one hand by both the need on the one to meet the learning outcomes of the programme, and the practicalities of delivery on the other.

In practice, the choices available to you will be made on the basis of an open and two-way discussion between you and your Head of Department.

If you are unhappy with the outcome of a discussion of your options with your Head of Department or other member of staff, then you should discuss the matter with the Head of Programme. If you are still not satisfied, you can approach the Director of Music. In all cases, whatever has been negotiated should be recorded on the Student Contract. It is the responsibility of the both the student and the Personal Supervisor to make sure that this is kept up to date.

## Transitions

'Transitions' is a term used to represent two phases of your studies: firstly, when you move into your studies, also known as 'induction'; secondly, when you leave the programme and move into either further study or the wider world.

In the induction phase you will meet your Head of Department and Head of Programme, and begin to negotiate your individual programme of study through the Student Contract.

As you approach the end of the programme, you will have the opportunity to meet with your Head of Department to discuss your future plans, either for moving into the profession or further study.

## Communication

After face-to-face communication, the most widely used mode of communication is email, which is used for all official correspondence. While in other spheres you may be used to communicating via chat platforms, direct messaging, or social media, it is important that you recognise that, during your studies on the programme, all of your electronic communication with your tutors will come via your Conservatoire email address. Neither staff nor students should use their private email address for matters relating to Conservatoire business.

## Calendar

#### Welcome and Transitions week (w/b Mon 25 Sep 2023)

During this week you will be involved in induction activities, with normal teaching beginning in week 2.

#### Undergraduate Reading Week (w/b Mon 06 Nov 2023)

For undergraduate students only, this is a week in which no classes or rehearsals are timetabled: it is also used as an auditions week by the School of Music. For this reason, some classes and many option modules will not run during this week. You should check your Asimut calendar for that week on to confirm your schedule. If you are still not sure, please check with your Head of Department, Head of Programme, or, in the case of an option module, the Module Coordinator.

#### Mid-Session Examinations (w/b Mon 6 Feb and w/b Mon 13 Feb 2023)

All undergraduate mid-session examinations take place during these two weeks. Postgraduate students _may_ have assessments during this week: however, for masters students, the timing of these can be flexibly negotiated, and they may well take place at a different time of year entirely. Many regular classes will not run during this week: please check your schedule.

#### Performance week (w/b Mon 04 Dec 2023)

Priority given to performances; some classes and option modules may not run. You should check your Asimut calendar for that week to confirm your schedule. If you are still not sure, please check with your Head of Department, the Head of MMus Programme, or, in the case of an option module, the Module Coordinator.

#### IXP Winter School (w/b Mon 11 Dec 2023)

Interdisciplinary and Extended Practice (IXP) modules run during this week: regular weekly undergraduate teaching and performance cease.

#### Mid-Session Examinations (w/b Mon 5 Feb and w/b Mon 12 Feb 2024)

All undergraduate mid-session examinations take place during these two weeks. Postgraduate students _may_ have B column assessments during this week: however, for ArtDip students, the timing of these can be flexibly negotiated, and they may well take place at a different time of year entirely. Many regular classes will not run during this week: please check your schedule.

#### IXP Spring School (w/b Mon 25 Mar 2024)

Interdisciplinary and Extended Practice (IXP) modules run during this week: regular weekly undergraduate teaching and performance cease.

#### Final Examinations (w/b Mon 27 May - w/b Mon 10 Jun 2024)

The majority of A column recitals for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will take place during these weeks. This is a busy time of year: some examinations may also be scheduled in the previous and following weeks, and over weekends. In certain cases, ArtDip students may take these examinations at another point in the year.

#### Transitions and Bridge Week (w/b Mon 17 Jun 2024)

In this final week of term 3 there is unlikely to be teaching or performance activity: some examinations may still be taking place, however. During this week, all students have the opportunity to pitch for self-directed collaborative projects, with successful pitches being resourced by the Conservatoire.

#### Resit Week (w/b Mon 12 Aug 2024)

Postponed 'first-sit' examinations, resit examinations, and resubmissions of failed modules typically take place during this week.

## Independent Learning, Autonomy and Resilience

In choosing to undertake an Artist Diploma, you have embarked upon a programme that offers you substantial scope to identify your own artistic aims. It will also require you to undertake a great deal of independent work, both in the practice room and in thinking critically about the work that you wish to produce. As well as working towards your chosen outputs for the Principal Project module, the Supporting Project module is designed to open up to you a range of learning opportunities within the School of Music and the Conservatoire as a whole. This balance of autonomous and collaborative work within a rich performing environment is intended to help you to develop the resilience to deal with challenges as they arise, both during the course of the programme and after you graduate.
