## Benchmarks

The learning outcomes of your programme are aligned with a number of local, national and international standards. The _UK Quality Code for Higher Education_ (UKQCHQ, QAA 2018) lays out a series of formal 'expectations', including that 'the academic standards of courses meet the requirements of the relevant national qualifications framework'. In Scotland, these comprise the _Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework_ (SCQF 2019) and _The Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutions in Scotland_ (FQHEIS, QAA 2018).

In accordance with the SCQF/FQHEIS, the Artist Diploma meets the requirement that a Postgraduate Diploma in Scotland allocate a minimum of 120 credit points, of which at least 100 are at SCQF Level 11. The programme and module learning outcomes have been benchmarked against the _SCQF Level Descriptors_ (SCQF 2015), while the programme as a whole meets the requirements of the _UKQCHQ Descriptor for a higher education qualification at level 7 on the FHEQ and SCQF level 11 on the FQHEIS: master's degree_ (QAA 2018).

In addition to these fundamental standards, the programme aims and learning outcomes also take account of:

- the relevant sections of the Conservatoire's Postgraduate Academic Framework, that are themselves based upon FQHEIS
- the _Characteristics Statement: Master's Degree_ (QAA 2015)
- the Dublin descriptors for second cycle awards (EHAA 2005)
- the 'Polifonia'/Dublin Descriptors for second cycle awards in higher music education (AEC 2007)
- the AEC Learning Outcomes 2017 (AEC 2017)

The Conservatoire – then the RSAMD – became in 1993/4 the first UK institution of its kind to be granted degree-awarding powers. We take pride in the care and rigour with which we design our degrees: you can be fully confident in the academic standing of the Artist Diploma.
