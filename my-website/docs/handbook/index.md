# Introduction
The Artist Diploma is intended for advanced students in music on the cusp of a professional career, who are seeking to hone a distinctive musical personality through a year of post-masters study in a conservatoire environment.

The programme is designed to give you time and space and to develop your art through a largely autonomous programme of study. In the Principal Project you will work towards an individually negotiated programme of high-level artistic outputs, such as performances, compositions, recordings, or documented research, according to the discipline. This module is supported by 20.25 hours of one-to-one lessons from a specialist tutor.

In the Supporting Project module, you will receive support and mentoring from a personal supervisor, who will help you to create an individual portfolio of supplementary activities to complement your main artistic projects. The module culminates in an oral examination that invites you to reflect critically on the artistic intentions of your work through the course of the programme.
