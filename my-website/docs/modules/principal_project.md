## Assessment 1

You will be assessed through one or two negotiated assessments (100% or 50% + 50%)

The negotiated assessments for this module will typically be performances, but may also be compositions, recordings, or documented research. As well as offering an artistic vehicle, it is expected that you will seek opportunities that will support your future professional development: examples might include: entering competitions; freelance work; professional recitals; and/or high quality audio and/or video recordings.At least one of these assessments will be assessed by an external panel, comprising a Specialist External Examiner, an internal specialist, and a generalist convener. Where there is a second assessment it will usually be carried out by a panel comprising two internal specialists.
